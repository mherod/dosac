00:02.680 --> 00:06.720
This programme contains adult humour
and strong language.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.960
I'm sorry I woke everybody up.
We could give the kids earplugs.
Or sedate them.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.680
Oh, bollocks! First in the SACK race.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.040
And they've capitalised "sack", in
case anybody thought it was a piece
about what a good sack racer I am.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.160
I have to go, I'm being carjacked
by a Jock. Carjocked.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.520
I'm very happy
with my broadband provider.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.160
We've other meetings around that
time, and I need to see all those.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.240
Glenn, can you put stuff with
staples through a shredder? No.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.000
Yes, you can. It does credit cards.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.840
Who's going to break
the news to Nicola?

00:34.840 --> 00:37.320
I'm going to do that
and do it alone.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.320
I'm going to give her the
pre-briefing and I'll blind her
with bad press and bumf.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.760
You do the...back of the neck.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.960
You've seen
the sack race thing, I suppose.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.000
It's not funny.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.480
It's not even accurate,
because I was fourth,

00:52.480 --> 00:54.680
so they should have said
I was fourth in the sack race.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.480
I think we should
complain to the PCC.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.400
Stop worrying. The PM isn't
going to sack you after a week.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.120
Sacked after 12 months,
it looks like you've fucked up.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.240
Sacked after a week,
it looks like he's fucked up.
I'm not doing terribly, am I?

01:09.760 --> 01:12.480
I love the way they've
sand-blasted everything around here.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.000
It's so clean.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.720
You've no time to shred those.
Please take them to the lavatory.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.280
Did she just say take them
to the lavatory? Are you going
to stand there like that? Yes.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.960
Are you going to give her an arch?
Just go and get her. She'll
never guess there's anything wrong.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.880
Fucking idiot. I'd just like people
to get to know the real me.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.080
I feel I come across as a bit...

01:34.080 --> 01:37.440
I dunno, glum. Smug.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.080
Smug? Yeah, you're coming
across more smug than glum.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.440
Because I am actually quite a
fun person underneath all this.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.440
I've got loads of friends.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.960
Well, I'm sure you have.
But the trouble is that when
you say something like that,

01:49.960 --> 01:53.039
it sounds a wee bit smug.

01:53.039 --> 01:54.720
Can you just pull in over here?

01:54.720 --> 01:57.720
And you can take out
that cyclist.
I think he's Shadow Cabinet.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.200
Sorry. Could you meet
me at the door tomorrow?

02:02.200 --> 02:05.240
It's like carrying two fridges in.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.440
Yes.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.120
Right, the lunch.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.120
I've gone with the Guardian.
I thought maybe not the Mail.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.920
They might be nice to your face,
then brand you
a man-hating Euro-slag.

02:15.920 --> 02:22.800
Ollie, if you had to choose three
nasty adjectives that described me,
what would they be? I'm sorry?

02:22.800 --> 02:25.480
Malcolm mentioned a pejorative word

02:25.480 --> 02:29.160
I hadn't thought of before,
so I'm keen to get your take.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.040
OK. Top three. Yes.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.880
Um...

02:35.880 --> 02:37.960
sour?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.480
OK.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.000
Grumpy.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.840
And uptight.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.680
Yeah, OK.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.520
I mean, why not egg-and-spoon?
Egg-and-spoon would have
been better than sack.

02:54.520 --> 02:59.120
Yeah, but, egg on face. She must
go spooner rather than later.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.360
If you'd dropped it, Yolk-o Oh No.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.760
Morning. Secretary of State.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.000
Yes. Something terrible has happened.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.080
Lovely, Terri. Beautifully finessed.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.200
What? It's my duty to advise you
of Appendix 4 of the Data
Protection Act's advisory notes

03:13.200 --> 03:15.040
to government departments.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.840
It sounds like you're arresting me.
Appendix what? Shut it, we'll
ask the questions here, Ma'am.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.440
I was being a policewoman.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.160
Somebody explain in simple terms
what has happened,

03:25.160 --> 03:31.280
because at the moment I think I've
wandered in to a cryptic crossword
compiled by Rumpel-fucking-stiltskin.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.760
Basically, every British citizen
who has arrived here in the
last seven-and-a-half months,

03:36.760 --> 03:38.360
their names have been wiped.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.520
The immigration database is blank.

03:42.960 --> 03:48.360
Oh, fuck! Oh!
Fuck! This is a fucking disaster.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.480
The last hope was that Ollie had
it on that thing, what is it?
A memory, er, stick.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.120
I only said it because it looked
like you were going to self-harm.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.840
They've got to be somewhere, surely.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.680
They're not actually in that drawer.
I'm getting Nurofen, Terri.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.520
Do you not back up, you people?

04:02.520 --> 04:06.240
I back up. I don't even
know what backing up means.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.560
I really thought today
we'd start the fightback.

04:09.560 --> 04:14.840
And it looks as though
we've started the fightback
by beating ourselves up

04:14.840 --> 04:17.240
and poking out our eyeballs
with our own fucking teeth.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.560
Jesus. Right, who primarily
should I be shouting at?

04:20.560 --> 04:23.040
Glenn. Oh, thank you very much.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.320
I have the minutes here
which are a record...

04:25.320 --> 04:27.760
You can't just overwrite minutes.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.400
You specifically can't do it,
because you can't
unlock the PDF file.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.040
Somebody has done a huge poo on
my desk and I want it cleared up.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.400
My bum is clean, clean as a whistle.
And I'm going to tell you
something interesting.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.920
Unless you take the hard drive
and smash it up with a hammer
or drop it in acid,

04:42.920 --> 04:44.800
that data will be retrievable.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.280
It says so on the BBC website.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.640
I need a short list of people
who are responsible.

04:49.640 --> 04:52.640
Glenn, will you bring me a short list
with your own name on it?

04:52.640 --> 04:56.920
Malcolm's on his way over. Bugger.
Does he know? I don't think so.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.440
Do you want me to go and ask?
No, don't ask him. All right!

04:59.440 --> 05:02.760
We need to cancel the Guardian lunch.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.880
No. No. No. That would be
a ridiculous signal to do that.

05:05.880 --> 05:13.200
It's the kind of signal
a dying whale sends out. Noooo!
We lost the immigration figures!

05:13.200 --> 05:15.240
Sort of a signal.

05:15.240 --> 05:19.960
Would you all please just fuck out of
my office for a long time. Very good.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.560
I got you a croissant.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.520
Morning, desk jockeys.
Is glummy mummy in?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.240
I think she's on the phone.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.960
Right, so why don't I just cool my
heels here? Good morning, Malcolm.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.200
Do you know, Malcolm...

05:37.800 --> 05:39.760
the best way to clear a paper jam?

05:41.280 --> 05:42.800
I don't know.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.600
Kill a kid an hour
until it sorts itself out?

05:46.600 --> 05:51.240
Excellent timing, Malcolm.
So if you could sort out
the sack race situation

05:51.240 --> 05:54.040
that would be terrific.
What would you like to do on that?

05:54.040 --> 05:58.920
Ideally, build a time machine
so we can go back and not invite
photographers to the sports day.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.440
If I fail to build a time machine?

06:00.440 --> 06:04.000
Just sit on it really, Terri.
Stop it growing.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.560
Zap it, like a tumour.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.080
Thank you. Yes.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.480
So, Malcolm.
Oh, incoming body parts, excuse me.

06:10.480 --> 06:15.280
If this has got any bigger,
you are going to feel the thump of
a fucking harpoon in your thorax.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.200
Does he know? Follow him.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.400
I hope you like shitting toenails,
because that is what you're going
to be doing all of next week.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.200
I've painted them yellow so
they look like fucking sweetcorn.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.840
The guy is a fucking liability.

06:28.840 --> 06:32.720
Jesus Christ.
Listen, I'm talking to myself...

06:34.680 --> 06:37.640
I couldn't hear everything.
He takes very long strides.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.800
What are you? A fucking penguin?
Just run.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.040
Look, I'm a civil servant,
not a fucking Olympic athlete.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.360
Right, what's occurring,
Hermann Goering?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.000
What?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.320
You're fucking kidding me.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.760
Excuse me.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.480
Two minutes and I will be back.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.720
I'm fucking OK for bollocks, mate.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.360
That's it. He knows.
Do you want me to follow him again?

07:07.360 --> 07:10.720
Yes, yes, no, YES! I'm Secretary
of State, yes. Do what I say.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.200
How is that list going? Who have we
covered, Glenn? Who's on the list?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.760
It's not a big list.
Well, get going on the bloody list.

07:18.600 --> 07:23.160
Hi, Robyn.
Hey, look, you know Phil Davis?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.520
Is he a Davies or a Davis?

07:25.520 --> 07:29.320
I know you don't like me, Glenn,
but you're not sacking me.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.520
FALSE LAUGHTER

07:31.520 --> 07:33.159
It's an inappropriate way.

07:33.159 --> 07:36.360
I'm protecting you!

07:36.360 --> 07:38.200
OK, well
I've got your back as well...

07:38.200 --> 07:42.520
even though I know you are
the guy who authorised
the wiping of the back-up.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.240
Well, that may or may not be true.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.920
Well, it is true.
Well, it may or it may not be true.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.680
Well, that is true.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.360
FALSE LAUGHTER

07:54.360 --> 07:58.800
The benefit of a short-term
strategy is that it allows you
to develop a long-term strategy.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.240
Explain it to them. We've just been
discussing the data loss incident.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.800
Can we not call it the incident?
It sounds like a toxic spillage.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.400
Kerfuffle?

08:06.400 --> 08:10.920
How's the time machine coming
along, Terri? Have you managed
to find a flux capacitor yet?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.480
Well, I had to go and fetch Glenn.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.120
It was a joke. Doesn't matter.

08:14.120 --> 08:21.440
I was thinking that one possible
strategy might be not to tell
anybody. What, keep it a secret?

08:21.440 --> 08:23.000
Sorry, sorry, Malcolm's coming back.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.080
Tell me more
about not saying anything.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.120
It's pretty self-explanatory.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.120
Or not. Robyn,
maybe you can get us some teas.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.720
OK, what does everybody want?

08:34.720 --> 08:37.320
I'll make a little list,
shall I, Glenn?

08:37.320 --> 08:38.919
A cappuccino, please.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.840
A herbal please, a lemon zinger.
Really? Yes, please.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.800
Little pigs. Little pigs.
Let me come in.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.600
Don't worry about the hair
on your chinny chin chin.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.120
So what was your call?

08:55.120 --> 08:57.840
What was my call?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.480
Did you...

08:59.480 --> 09:01.480
You want to know what my call was?

09:01.480 --> 09:03.080
Was it important?

09:05.360 --> 09:11.560
I'm sorry, I didn't realise I had
to run all my calls through your
bed wetters' switchboard here.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.680
I usually just dial 118.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.640
Malcolm, do you know?
Obviously he knows.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.480
No, he doesn't!

09:17.480 --> 09:20.840
There has been a massive
irretrievable data loss.

09:20.840 --> 09:28.000
The last seven months' worth of
new immigrant details have gone,
apparently lost in the computer.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.040
Oh ho, ho, ho...

09:41.800 --> 09:45.720
D'you know what's really fucking
sad here

09:45.720 --> 09:49.800
is that I don't even have the energy
to pretend I already knew.

09:51.920 --> 09:57.040
Which is for the best, because
I'm going to need all of my fucking
energy to fucking rip all of your...

09:57.040 --> 10:02.080
bodies to bits with my bare hands,
and sell off, yes sell off your

10:02.080 --> 10:07.640
fucking flayed skin as a sleeping
bag to a fucking normal person.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.720
Can I just say that getting angry
isn't going to help?

10:10.720 --> 10:17.840
I've done anger, I'm currently at
grief and I'm working my way towards
bargaining, whatever.

10:17.840 --> 10:23.560
You're behind me.
So, what is your great strategy
for dealing with this?

10:23.560 --> 10:27.600
Come on, I'm fucking all ears.
I'm fucking Andrew Marr here.
So, Terri, let's hear...

10:27.600 --> 10:30.240
Let's go, let's get going.
High-level tactical discussion.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.600
I'm up for it. Right,
blaming the department minister
might be a high-risk strategy.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.800
Oh, high risk. Saucy. Power serve.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.320
My pitch would be this department
is fatally flawed.

10:41.320 --> 10:46.280
It's out of condition, obese,
asthmatic... Back over the net. You
need to be really sure about that.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.120
Yes, wise words from
the distinguished, elderly,
gay fucking tennis coach here.

10:51.120 --> 10:56.480
Seriously, I think we should talk
about my strategy further, because
I really think that's the way...

10:56.480 --> 10:59.800
Yeah, the fucking wee ball-boy's
having a go now, with his wee
fucking tight shorts on.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.840
What about Sue Barker's little
sister? What's she got to say?

11:02.840 --> 11:05.000
Have you got something to say,
to add to the conversation?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.160
No, just that there
was no lemon zinger,

11:07.160 --> 11:10.280
so this is just a coffee.
Is that all right?
Do the Guardian know about this?

11:10.280 --> 11:13.840
Oh, fart. I don't fucking
Guardian, I don't know.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.520
Yes, as it's referred
to in my department.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.040
Shall I find out? Get some feelers?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.360
Yeah, go on, get your
feelers out for the lads.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.920
What do you think, Malcolm?

11:20.920 --> 11:22.600
Shitting on the department?
Will that work?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.400
Yes, let's cause a
little bit of friction.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.200
Let's fire someone.
What about Glenn?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.960
No, you can't just fire Glenn like
that. Well, we could fire Glenn.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.720
Shall I get his file?
No, I've got a list.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.200
See? There you are, he's got a list.
You're a new broom,
you're sweeping up

11:37.200 --> 11:42.480
trouble with one end,
broom-handling incompetent
staff up the tunnel with the other.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.360
So, Malcolm, how do we
play it at the Guardian?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.880
Smile, be gay.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.160
Smile, smile, smile.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.840
So, who's going to be there? Plenty.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.720
There's going to be all the hacks.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.320
There's the editor, the leader
writer, all the political staff...

11:58.320 --> 12:02.400
...unfortunately, I heard that
that so-called cartoonist
is going to be there.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.920
You know the one who drew the picture
of you smothering the dove of peace

12:04.920 --> 12:07.560
with your breasts,
for no apparent reason?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.440
D'you want to run any policy stuff?

12:09.440 --> 12:13.720
Any lines? What about the
plastic versus wooden toys thing?

12:13.720 --> 12:18.960
Oh God, no. That was 4:00am stuff
to be filed away

12:18.960 --> 12:21.760
with community support park-keepers.

12:21.760 --> 12:27.440
Complete top of the head stuff.
No, no. I think this is about
showing the real Nicola.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.360
Operation not smug, not glum.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.160
Well, I'm told this lunch
is on the 5th floor.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.360
It's taking a while.
Maybe we should just walk.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.440
I'm not walking to the 5th floor.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.800
I would actually like to be able to
speak by the time we get up there.

12:45.800 --> 12:50.800
No, look. If I go in to the lift,
I become convinced that I'm going
to die, so I'm going to walk.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.360
I'm sorry.
Claustrophobic. I'm sorry.

12:53.360 --> 12:58.120
I'll just check that
for the duration of the lunch
we're all off the record.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.960
We're are happy to be on.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.200
No, off is best.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
It's a bit like when
the snooker comes on, on the telly.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.520
You know, just off, off.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.360
How's it going with her?

13:12.360 --> 13:15.520
How are you finding her? Nicola?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.040
Very...

13:19.280 --> 13:22.200
Good. Fun.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.200
Hello! Hello, Nicola Murray.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.640
Hello, Nicola Murray. Ooh,
this is all very formal, isn't it?

13:29.640 --> 13:31.200
We need to lighten up.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.800
I like to use the stairs sometimes
to, you know, just a bit of a laugh.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.040
So, well done. Bit of a
baptism of fire, first week.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.040
The whole I'm bent
thing and the sack race stuff.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.760
Oh, God. Yes, that was annoying.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.080
And hilarious.
Annoying and hilarious?

13:46.080 --> 13:48.840
Yes, like Russell Brand.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.480
You want to hate him,
but he's just funny.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.480
It's like the current problems.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.640
Which problems in particular?

13:58.640 --> 14:01.640
Just asking. We're off the record.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.760
I'm not playing any games with you,
I'm not tobogganing or anything like
that. Well, it's only been a week.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.120
A lot of data to keep on top of,
I imagine.

14:08.120 --> 14:11.040
It really is. Or are.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.640
Is, are. Data, dunno. Plural?

14:14.640 --> 14:16.160
Come on, you're the Guardian!

14:19.520 --> 14:21.960
We do very much keep on top of it.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.840
Or them. The datas.

14:24.840 --> 14:28.840
That's a very important part of what
we do. And we back up everything.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.840
All the time. Afternoon, ladies.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.520
I heard there were sandwiches
and I'm a fucker for cress.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.600
No, please don't get up. I'm not
Viagra. Geoffrey, good to see you.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.360
John, how are you doing?
I just want to tell you,
I really enjoyed your novel...

14:43.360 --> 14:46.280
Thank you very much. ..way of
writing a fucking awful story.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.840
Joking, joking.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.920
So! Hey? She's not smug.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.520
She's not sour, is she?

14:53.520 --> 14:56.840
Thanks, Malcolm.
What it is is that these bastards,

14:56.840 --> 15:01.120
the other bastards, they are
selling her as smug and sour.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.000
You know why that is?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.520
Because she's a proper person with
dyed roots and stretch marks.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.560
She's not one of these arseholes
that goes on The One Show

15:10.560 --> 15:13.880
fucking laughing their heads off
about the Apprentice or whatever.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.040
She's ordinary.
And they can't handle that, yes?

15:17.040 --> 15:22.280
That's why we need you guys,
the good guys on side.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.200
They've simply got to get
through you. You couldn't be closer.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.560
I'll talk closer to you...

15:27.560 --> 15:30.600
That's enough!
I don't want to do that.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.880
Not with the old wandering
hands syndrome that you've got.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.840
Have you managed to patch it up?
Not now.

15:36.840 --> 15:41.040
Not now, Malcolm thanks.
Are you still sleeping in the car?

15:41.040 --> 15:45.200
So Nicola, we talked about
immigration. What's going to happen

15:45.200 --> 15:48.960
when there is the next
inevitable immigration foul-up?

15:48.960 --> 15:52.600
How's that going to work? Look,
she's been in the job a week, right?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.000
The department's shit,
they're fucking shit.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.760
She's working her fucking
lady bollocks off trying to get
things done in there.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.840
She's really doing all right.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.920
All right?

16:02.920 --> 16:07.360
Fuck's sake. Well, a week
is a short time in politics.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.600
I think as a rule I will be very
happy to come and talk policy.

16:11.600 --> 16:16.080
Fantastic. That's great. What's a
trademark Nicola Murray policy?

16:16.080 --> 16:22.120
Well, there's the wooden
toys...thing.

16:22.120 --> 16:26.240
Brilliant. We're knocking
about some ideas about plastics.

16:26.240 --> 16:29.080
I'm aware that my kids'
toy box is full of plastic.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.960
They have very few
of the wooden toys

16:33.960 --> 16:37.360
that would've been traditionally
played with by their forefathers.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.160
And fore...mothers.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.320
Big family!

16:43.840 --> 16:48.280
Plastics sometimes contain
carcinogens.

16:48.280 --> 16:54.240
So, first step I think is going to
be trying to de-carcinogeni-size...

16:54.240 --> 16:59.200
..toys. Mass de-carcinogenicide.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.640
The simple message would be,
let's get back to wood.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.400
Simple wooden toys.

17:06.400 --> 17:12.400
For simple...people, children.
It's very early days.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.800
And obviously we
will tighten that up a bit.

17:18.800 --> 17:25.680
So? Good? Good. Good.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.079
Good. Fine.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.960
Good.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.440
Funny old department
to come into, isn't it?

17:32.440 --> 17:39.800
Obviously you shied away from
talking about it in there, but
immigration, is that all sorted now?

17:39.800 --> 17:43.160
Right. We weren't sure
whether you knew or not...

17:43.160 --> 17:44.920
Yes, that's DoSAC.

17:44.920 --> 17:50.760
You say that, I had no idea
when I came in that we were
just haemorrhaging citizenship data.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.680
Haemorrhaging?
Yeah, the last six months' worth.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.440
Did you know? Well, we do now.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.680
Thank God we off the record.
Bye bye, John. Lovely to meet you.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.920
Sorry, bye bye.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.520
I didn't catch your name?
It's Marianne.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.680
Marianne, right.
You were at the lunch, weren't you?

18:12.680 --> 18:15.080
No, I'm a freelancer.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.120
I'm just doing some feature shifts.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.320
Sorry, Marianne!

18:20.320 --> 18:24.040
You were behind us just now
coming down the stairs, weren't you?

18:24.040 --> 18:27.240
So you heard
what we were talking about.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.680
But we were off the record so...
Well...very nice to meet you anyway.

18:36.720 --> 18:43.000
Shit. Shit. Hey! French Lieutenant's
woman, we're over here. Come on.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.800
What are you doing?
Marking out your territory?

18:44.800 --> 18:47.160
Welcome to the mother ship.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.680
I need some air.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.520
Ollie...open the door.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
She's not a post-match puker,
is she?

18:54.080 --> 18:55.760
Come on! What is it?

18:55.760 --> 19:00.000
Over there, there's a woman, with
red hair, woman on the phone. She
was behind me on the stairs.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.480
I thought she was off the record,
she was on the record,
so I need you to go over

19:03.480 --> 19:05.480
and take whatever was on
the record off the record.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.400
What...?
Don't be thick! For once just go
over there and just say it's off.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.400
Say whatever it was is off the
record. Go, now, run! All right!

19:13.400 --> 19:14.800
I don't know what she said.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.320
Yep.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.120
I'm going to miss my
wine-tasting again tonight.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.960
I expect you're probably
more a single malt man.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.440
I quite like her at times.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.000
For fuck's sake. Have we not
both got BlackBerries to check?

19:37.640 --> 19:42.360
Marion, I'm not threatening you,
but... What? Like I said,
I'm not threatening you...

19:42.360 --> 19:46.320
Usually the phrase,
"I'm not threatening you, but..."
is followed by a threat.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.480
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
I'm really sorry.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.240
Fuck's sake!

19:52.240 --> 19:55.800
Jesus Christ! Now we've got another

19:55.800 --> 19:59.400
fucking adjective to add to
fucking smug and glum, haven't we?

19:59.400 --> 20:02.040
Fucking retarded! Jesus!

20:02.040 --> 20:05.560
Do you not think it would be germane
to check who you're talking to?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.160
It's a fucking newspaper office.

20:07.160 --> 20:11.840
It's not a fucking sanatorium
for the fucking deaf, is it?
Are you so dense?

20:11.840 --> 20:14.960
I'm now going to have to run around
slapping badges on people.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.080
I'll put a big tick on some and
a big cross on others, so you know

20:18.080 --> 20:20.400
when to shut your gob
and when to open it!

20:20.400 --> 20:23.440
Jesus Christ! That would probably
confuse you as well, won't it?

20:23.440 --> 20:25.160
That'd be too confusing.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.520
You'll see the cross and think,
"X marks the spot".

20:28.520 --> 20:33.160
Better tell this little person
about the Prime Minister's
catastrophic erectile dysfunction.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.960
Oh, but not to worry, not to worry.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.840
You've sent Ollie over there...

20:36.840 --> 20:41.840
Fucking Ollie? He's a fucking
knitted scarf, that twat.
He's a balaclava.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.520
You're on very shaky legal ground.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.640
No, I'm really not. Am I? ..Oh.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.560
Look, the department's not
fit for purpose, really.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.280
No, it's not. Terri's quite bad...

20:52.280 --> 20:56.760
Not just Terri, I'm not going to
name names, but there's Robyn.
Robyn's shit.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.360
All right. Fuck off.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.840
I'm sure we can settle
this matter of...

21:01.840 --> 21:04.920
You were eavesdropping
on a private conversation?

21:06.440 --> 21:09.320
It was a public conversation.

21:09.320 --> 21:15.480
No, you think you're so clever
and you are so totally wanking with
the wrong crowd here, because...

21:15.480 --> 21:18.160
This man, right,
this man is the press.

21:18.160 --> 21:22.000
I mis-spoke and I mis-saw you.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.040
Nicola. Fuck. What've I done?

21:24.040 --> 21:26.040
D'you think this is going
to advance your career?

21:26.040 --> 21:28.120
At least my career's
got a trajectory,

21:28.120 --> 21:31.720
whereas yours is about to crash
head-on into a change of government.

21:31.720 --> 21:35.760
Don't you worry, because I can
still steer some fucking flaming
wreckage in your direction.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.680
Once it's printed,
I promise I'll come back to you
for reaction quote. How's that?

21:39.680 --> 21:43.280
Darling, I wouldn't fucking piss on
you if you were allergic to piss.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.000
On the you go. Walk the walk.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.760
Fuck right off. Go on.

21:47.760 --> 21:52.200
We'll live through this, won't we?
Nicola, I've got the list
whenever you're ready. I'm ready now.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.760
I can do it in reverse order like the
pop charts. How was meet the press?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.760
Not great. They didn't know
about the data loss, they do now.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.760
OK. Well, off the record,
they can't use any of it.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.760
No, I was ambushed by a
not-off-the-record journalist.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.720
Never mind! Onwards and upwards!

22:06.720 --> 22:08.960
Oh, fuck! From now on, none
of us let her out of our sight.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.280
She's not to be trusted.
Sorry, Minister. Terri?

22:11.280 --> 22:14.040
Yes? Where in the Civil Service
guidelines does it say that it's

22:14.040 --> 22:17.840
absolutely fine to leave
your minister alone
with a hostile journalist

22:17.840 --> 22:21.960
if you just can't be arsed
to walk down the stairs?
I'd already pressed the button.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.360
However, it was supposed
to be on Ollie's stick,
so he is the last man standing.

22:26.360 --> 22:32.080
Hey! At least I know how to use a
stick, Mr Floppy. Have you finished?
Well, no.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.560
I imagine I'm going to have to be
doing it over and over again until
you go on the fucking course.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.440
OK. Let's call a truce.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.040
Let's agree that nobody in this
room is going to be sacked, OK?

22:41.040 --> 22:44.360
For now. I've still got the original
list here, let's start with that.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.640
Top of the list is Kelly Peters. No.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.800
Why not? She's a very nice girl,
Kelly Peters. She's very kind.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.960
She often lends me hardbacks.
Terri, the Mail is on the phone.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.200
Christ.
Don't worry, I'll deal with it.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.600
I'll deal with it.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.160
Robyn?

23:00.160 --> 23:04.120
What? Yeah. No, absolutely not.
There are too many implications.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.120
We simply cannot go with the
idea of sacking Robyn. OK?

23:07.120 --> 23:10.480
Are you sleeping with her? What? No!

23:10.480 --> 23:13.680
Although every time he does see her
in his head he just hears...

23:13.680 --> 23:16.360
# Bam-chicka-bam-bam... #

23:16.360 --> 23:19.320
Ollie! It just seems to me that all
we'd be losing if we got rid of

23:19.320 --> 23:21.440
Robyn is somebody who makes
a week cup of tea.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.480
PHONE RINGS

23:21.440 --> 23:24.480
Shit. Malcolm. Hello.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.320
Get over here, now.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.200
It might be advisable to wear
brown trousers. And a shirt
the colour of blood.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.400
It has all gone HBO.

23:34.400 --> 23:40.720
I have got to go to Number Ten now.
Now? Need a coat and you, Terri.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.720
Really? Fuck shoes!

23:45.240 --> 23:47.080
Do you want me to come with you too?
Yes.

23:47.080 --> 23:50.600
Shit. OK, we're off.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.200
I'm wondering whether to
take the lift, no I can't.

23:53.200 --> 24:00.120
I just wanted to see to you
by the way of introductory remarks
that I'm extremely miffed about

24:00.120 --> 24:01.960
today's events.

24:01.960 --> 24:06.840
In my quest to try and make
you understand the level of my

24:06.840 --> 24:13.920
unhappiness, I'm likely to use
an awful lot of what we would call
violent sexual imagery.

24:13.920 --> 24:18.760
I just wanted to check
that neither of you would be
terribly offended by that.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.920
I could actually do without
the theatrics, Malcolm. Enough.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.160
E-fucking-nuff.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.680
You need to learn
to shut your fucking cave, right?

24:28.680 --> 24:33.800
Today, you have laid your first
big, fat egg of solid fuck.

24:33.800 --> 24:39.880
You took the data loss
media strategy and you ate it
with a lump of E-coli.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.800
Then you sprayed it out
of your arse at 300 mph.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.800
I simply made a mistake, Malcolm.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.280
You got on the record
and off the record mixed up.

24:48.280 --> 24:51.320
What would have happened if
George Martin had done that?

24:51.320 --> 24:53.800
There would be no
fucking Beatles, that's what.

24:53.800 --> 24:58.320
I don't give a fuck about that.
I've had to sit next to Paul
McCartney at fucking Chequers.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.360
The data loss wasn't my fault.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.640
I tell you what, it came out
pretty fast once you were
in there, didn't it?

25:04.640 --> 25:07.400
Which makes me wonder should
I just go and talk to the boss,

25:07.400 --> 25:09.320
should I tell him
I don't think she's up to the job.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.760
You said if he sacked me after a
week it looks like he's fucked up.

25:12.760 --> 25:19.160
But that was before, when your only
problem was a shit pun in a newspaper

25:19.160 --> 25:23.080
and a face like Dot Cotton
licking piss off a nettle.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.600
OK. I messed up. I messed up but...

25:26.600 --> 25:30.680
I will from now on listen to
every bit of advice you give me.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.280
I'll go on Question Time wearing
a push-up bra and a fez.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.680
I'll do the hustings on stilts
if that is what

25:38.680 --> 25:41.560
you tell me the strategy is because
you know about that stuff, Malcolm.

25:41.560 --> 25:45.600
I know that. It's just that I've got
things that I want to do, all right?

25:45.600 --> 25:49.200
Of course you do.
You want to sort out rocking horses?

25:49.200 --> 25:51.960
No. The Mail have the
mother lode on this, right.

25:51.960 --> 25:55.720
That means there is a way
through this for us but it entails

25:55.720 --> 26:01.560
you, my dear, eating a complete
concrete mixer full of humble pie.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.240
What's the strategy?

26:05.120 --> 26:08.960
The Kraken awakes. No, it's just that
this is the first bit of the meeting

26:08.960 --> 26:13.240
there hasn't been without expletives
and fezzes and stilts
and tea bagging.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.600
This is the bit that
relates to media management.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.640
I didn't say anything
about tea bagging.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.120
D'you know what that is?

26:20.120 --> 26:21.920
Not really, no.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.280
I'm told it's unpleasant.
Who do you want me to call?

26:24.280 --> 26:26.680
The Mail. Get them in.

26:26.680 --> 26:30.600
OK, Cheeky Girls, back on tour.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.760
Love your work.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.800
This is Marianne from the Mail.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.600
I've told you
who I want you to fire.

26:37.600 --> 26:41.040
I want you to do it,
not me, because I'm

26:41.040 --> 26:43.840
relatively popular around here and
frankly you've got nothing to lose.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.520
This is it, Robyn.
This is me true to my word.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.640
Andrew, mate. Sorry, nothing
personal. Clear your desk and go.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.400
Please don't hit me,
I'm wearing glasses.

26:55.400 --> 27:01.840
I'd just like to say to your readers
that the person responsible is being

27:01.840 --> 27:05.840
fast-tracked to the dole
queue as fast as her kitten heels
will carry her.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.480
You need to leave your badge.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.160
Security. Stick it.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.880
Andrew, please don't
take it like this, please.

27:12.880 --> 27:16.760
We're going to sort this mess out.
Andrew!

27:16.760 --> 27:20.640
What is going on out there?

27:20.640 --> 27:22.840
That was...

27:22.840 --> 27:25.120
the person responsible.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.080
Didn't you say something
about kitten heels?

27:28.080 --> 27:31.280
It's never a pretty business
but he made mistakes.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.120
And he had to go.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.760
Ollie, perhaps you could
show Marianne to the lifts.

27:36.760 --> 27:41.240
Actually I thought I might
take the stairs and see what else
I can pick up on my way out.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.160
Very funny.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.080
Hi, Nicola.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.360
Nicola, you all right?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.280
Robyn, could you get me some tea?

27:50.280 --> 27:52.400
Now.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.640
Um...bad moment?

27:55.640 --> 27:58.600
You sacked the wrong person.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.080
They're all bad moments.
Glenn, how is she?

28:01.080 --> 28:04.160
She looks so glum.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.480
She looks like I feel
when I visit Sheffield.

28:08.200 --> 28:12.560
The Guardian didn't like us
going on the record to the Mail.
I did try and spin it.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.240
I got them to take "frowny" out.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.440
No, you didn't, that is
the second adjective.

28:17.440 --> 28:22.200
Well, I did do something.
Nicola Murray, looking glum
and frowny, was overheard...

28:22.200 --> 28:26.720
Glenn, mate. What would you do if you
found that a dongle that everybody

28:26.720 --> 28:32.280
thought was lost was right at
the bottom of your second-best bag?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.560
I don't think we'd want it back.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.880
One of her gems is a plan
to outlaw plastic toys.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.560
Right now, Ollie, Nicola hates us.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.560
If she knew we'd found it,
she'd start laughing.

28:44.560 --> 28:48.960
Hating is better then laughing.
Trust me.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.560
Why anyone would want a brand her
a killjoy or sourpuss is beyond us.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.680
That's it, "sourpuss".

28:53.680 --> 28:59.240
They wanted to put "sour",
I suggested the puss. Morning.

28:59.240 --> 29:04.600
I'll see if I can find
a hammer and some acid.
