WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.600
This programme contains
discriminatory language,
strong language and adult humour

00:05.600 --> 00:08.840
You'll have to bog off.
Morning, Olly. How's your head?
Like a bat shat in it?

00:08.840 --> 00:10.960
No. If anything, I am hung under.

00:10.960 --> 00:15.640
First DoSAC party under the new
regime, you lasted, I'd say,
until seven...

00:15.640 --> 00:17.640
Yeah. Well, I do have a life, Olly.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.360
Yes, but only in the way that
jellyfish or athlete's foot
have a life.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.720
What was it last night, then?

00:22.720 --> 00:26.360
Candlelit anniversary dinner
for one?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.000
Hello.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.320
Terri, what actually are you up to?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.320
Are you still drunk?

00:31.320 --> 00:34.200
No. I had to get in early anyway
because the BBC man's coming.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.680
Are you wearing trainers?
You ARE wearing trainers.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.760
Yes.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.760
Yes. If Signal toothpaste made
trainers, that's what they'd
look like.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.000
I don't see there's any...

00:45.000 --> 00:47.160
This colour for healthy breath.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.560
Morning. Morning.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.080
Do, please, let me.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.840
Thank you very much.

00:51.840 --> 00:52.880
Can I take your coffee?

00:52.880 --> 00:55.360
Oh, no. I'm clinging onto
that for dear life.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.480
It will dehydrate you.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.000
Good-o.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.760
Mojito Murray, they now call her.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.040
You know, they had to
install speed bumps at the bar.
She's like Gazza at Euro '96.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.840
I really love the division of
labour in this place.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.039
I like the way the women
do the heavy lifting and
the men do the heavy sarcasm.

01:11.039 --> 01:13.320
Would you like
some help with your make-up?

01:13.320 --> 01:15.880
I'm wearing make-up.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.520
So this interview, who's coming?

01:17.520 --> 01:18.960
Ten o'clock news.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.000
Who...Nick Robinson?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Not Nick. He's away with the PM
on the world tour. No. It's Gavin.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.440
Gavin Esler.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.280
Gavin Boyes.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.480
Who the hell is Gavin Boyes?

01:29.480 --> 01:32.000
He's up and coming.
In what? Gay porn?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.240
I'm launching the fourth sector

01:32.000 --> 01:36.240
initiative. It's the centrepiece of

01:32.000 --> 01:36.240
my political career.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.720
I don't want to do it to some
Newsround press packer.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.280
It says here, on Google,
that Gavin Boyes

01:42.280 --> 01:46.600
is the state wrestling champion
for West Virginia.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.759
The launch tonight,
how many journos coming?

01:48.759 --> 01:50.280
We've got confirmed, four.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.600
ALL: Four!? That's one per sector.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.360
It's not something we are ashamed
of. We're not launching
a new leper colony.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.360
OK. No problem. I'm just going to go
down and collect Gavin and his BOYS.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.400
Welcome to DoSAC, Gavin.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.440
Thank you. Gavin Boyes!

02:04.440 --> 02:08.000
I'm Glen Cullen.
No need for me to get up.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.560
Right. Nice to meet you.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.320
Seems very nice, young but...

02:12.320 --> 02:14.840
Is this the way to
the face-painting tent?

02:14.840 --> 02:17.200
I was hoping I could
be a tiger, maybe.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.960
I told you you've overdone it with
the make-up. With the lights, you
do need it a lot on.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.880
Take a bit off. I'm going to start
slurring my words in a minute.
It looks great.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.840
Gavin Boyes, hello.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.040
Just pop you over there.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.640
We'll start with an easy one.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.079
Just relax.

02:33.079 --> 02:34.880
Yes. I was.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.160
Nicola, just relax.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.400
Secretary of State, could you
explain what your launch
is all about?

02:39.400 --> 02:43.200
Well, Gavin, the fourth sector is
really about empowering ordinary

02:43.200 --> 02:48.920
people to give a little bit extra
and thus create something extra...

02:48.920 --> 02:51.520
I'm so sorry, can I just...
just one second, sorry.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
You all right?

02:52.520 --> 02:57.200
You're very close and you're staring

02:52.520 --> 02:57.200
at me like a dead-eyed shark.

02:52.520 --> 02:57.200
It's making me tense.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.560
Sure. Sure.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.320
Sorry. Where were we?

03:01.320 --> 03:04.320
So why is the PM
doing this world tour thing?

03:04.320 --> 03:09.000
What's the point of that? I mean,
he's not easy on the world stage,
is he?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.920
He walks like his dick's made of
glass, you know. Is it a Malc plan?

03:12.920 --> 03:16.320
It could be. You know Steve
Fleming's back. It could be him.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.640
If he's back, it really is the end.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.640
What will you do when the ship

03:16.320 --> 03:19.640
goes down?

03:19.640 --> 03:22.079
Oh, plenty of options, Olly.

03:22.079 --> 03:24.760
You could be a beefeater.
Do you want to be a beefeater?

03:24.760 --> 03:27.640
Don't you worry about me, Olly.
I've got contacts.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.280
What do you mean, don't worry about
me? Are you big in Japan?

03:31.280 --> 03:32.960
What, what's that smile for?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.960
Do you need winding?

03:34.960 --> 03:38.600
I'm going to stand...in the election.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.000
Are you serious?

03:40.000 --> 03:45.720
Yeah.
I should hear later today whether or
not I've got enough support

03:45.720 --> 03:47.640
for the Ilford East long list.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.160
Fucking hell!

03:49.160 --> 03:52.400
You on a massive poster.
What's your slogan going to be?

03:52.400 --> 03:55.240
"He's old and sullen,
vote for Cullen." How about that?

03:55.240 --> 03:57.920
Actually, I'm pretty excited by this.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.000
It's hard to take on board. It's
like being told your dad's gay or
something.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.520
I am strangely really proud of you.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.120
The Prime Minister fully endorses
my fourth sector initiative.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.160
I know that's something
he's really squarely behind.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.960
Surely you can't ignore the

04:11.160 --> 04:14.960
nay-sayers who say he's a lame duck,

04:11.160 --> 04:14.960
not fit for the job?

04:14.960 --> 04:17.839
I believe that Tom is absolutely
the best man for the job

04:17.839 --> 04:21.040
and I think we should all just
let him get on with doing that job.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.600
What's morale like in the party?

04:22.600 --> 04:26.040
Sorry... One sec, I just said best
MAN for the job, I think, didn't I?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.280
I need to say best PERSON.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.240
It's kind of the same, you'd have to
be very PC to pick a hole in that.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.520
You don't want to give
the impression you'd like
a female leader?

04:34.520 --> 04:37.840
Absolutely. At some point,
I would love there to be
a female leader,

04:37.840 --> 04:41.159
but that point
isn't reached yet, you know,

04:41.159 --> 04:46.520
and I believe the current prime
minister is absolutely the best
PERSON

04:46.520 --> 04:48.360
for the... Yes. ..job.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.440
Yes. Yep. Got it.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.080
Best person for the job.
You did get that, did you?

04:53.080 --> 04:56.200
Yeah. You got the end. Yeah. We got
all we need. Thanks very much.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.720
OK. (MOUTHS) Was it all right?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.600
It was perfect.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.160
It wasn't perfect cos I said

04:59.600 --> 05:04.160
"best man" and I corrected to

04:59.600 --> 05:04.160
"person" and you kept going "Urgh".

05:04.160 --> 05:06.400
I wouldn't give it a second thought,
honestly.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.840
Give our...our very best

05:06.400 --> 05:09.840
to John Craven and Dexter Fletcher.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.600
Right. So, Ben Swain, the man
you love to hate and love to sack,
actually, is on his way up.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.880
Oh, great.
I'm flypaper for dickheads today.

05:17.880 --> 05:22.400
I'm going to get out of this funeral

05:17.880 --> 05:22.400
suit and chisel off the first

05:17.880 --> 05:22.400
three inches of make-up.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.600
Ah, the prodigal Swain returns.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.160
Menstrual cycle,
Ben on the 4th July.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.760
Olly, put the kettle on.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.880
Oh, the good ship Olly-pop,
old lang syne.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.240
How are things at the Department
of Education, Education, Education?

05:35.240 --> 05:38.560
Going at the foot pump mainly because
you are the Robin Hood of politics.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.720
Robin Hood was a hero.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.400
He was not a hero,
he was a terrorist.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.960
You're stealing from the education
department, pumping it out as a
DoSAC idea.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.920
This Back On Track policy that you
launched at your chimps' tea party
last night,

05:48.920 --> 05:51.080
well, that sounds
very similar, very, very...

05:51.080 --> 05:54.320
almost identical to my Unify Policy
that I was working on here

05:54.320 --> 05:58.159
til I was booted out by
knicker face. Where is Jenni Murray?

05:58.159 --> 06:00.920
I really wouldn't go in...

05:58.159 --> 06:00.920
SCREAMING

05:58.159 --> 06:00.920
Oh, God! Jesus!

06:00.920 --> 06:02.680
She's just been doing an interview.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.400
An interview for what? FHM?
What's she done to her face?

06:05.400 --> 06:08.600
She looks like a pissed Aunt Sally.
I'm really sorry...

06:08.600 --> 06:11.120
Let's not talk about it ever again.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.240
I will forget...

06:12.240 --> 06:13.640
What do you want?
..everything I've seen.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.520
Back On Track, it is exactly the same
as my Unify Initiative.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.280
You don't like me, that's as clear as
fish piss by kicking me out after you
arrive.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.200
Malcolm's calling. I thought he was

06:24.200 --> 06:27.760
sluicing sand out of Tom's thong in
Ibiza or wherever they've got to.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.080
He is. He's away in Spain.
Just ignore Malcolm.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.159
Ignore Malcolm?

06:32.159 --> 06:37.760
What can he do? Olly, you're not
answering your and I'm getting
worried that you've hurt yourself.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.440
I just keep getting these terrible
images flashing in my head.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.880
Of you being stabbed
repeatedly in the face.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.880
Or you in a coma
on a life-support machine

06:45.880 --> 06:49.400
dreaming about being
a gay policeman in the 1970s.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.680
Malcolm, I can explain.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.680
Olly, thank God that you're safe.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.080
Sorry.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.360
That's from me.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.320
What's Giant Haystacks doing here?

07:00.320 --> 07:04.600
I am here, Malcolm, because Nicola
has been nicking my policies,
through Olly.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.400
Is this true, the little man
in the red and yellow car? No.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.240
I've been told by Steve Fleming
to think the unthinkable.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.000
Well, listen, I am telling you
to unthink the unthinkable.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.080
You can't even cope with thinking
the thinkable. Why are you here?

07:17.080 --> 07:20.320
Hello, Malcolm. You look a bit tired.
You look incompetent.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.000
Tired and a wee bit grumpy.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.800
Well, actually, Lucille Ballbag,

07:24.800 --> 07:28.240
I am here to prep Nicola here
for her BBC interview.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.400
A bit late for that.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.000
Terri, I fucking e-mailed you and I
told you to move it to later because

07:34.000 --> 07:37.240
I wanted to administer a preparatory

07:34.000 --> 07:37.240
fucking verbal cosh. Right?

07:37.240 --> 07:38.480
Well...

07:38.480 --> 07:42.640
And there it is.
Didn't fuck...didn't fucking send.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.720
It didn't send. Right? There you go.
You just owe me an apology,
that's all.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.000
I'm sorry?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.280
That's the one.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.159
That wasn't an apology, that was
a "pardon, I'm sorry?".

07:52.159 --> 07:53.440
Why aren't you on the Tom tour?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.159
Yeah. I heard Steve
Fleming was on the tour.

07:56.159 --> 07:57.720
Big beast.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.360
Tiny fucking rodent, more like.
He's part of the larger problem.
Which is?

08:01.360 --> 08:05.640
Have you been in Number Ten lately?

08:01.360 --> 08:05.640
Jesus. It's like the break-up of

08:01.360 --> 08:05.640
The Beatles.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.120
During the fall of the Roman Empire,

08:05.640 --> 08:10.120
while fucking Jordan's getting

08:05.640 --> 08:10.120
divorced from

08:10.120 --> 08:14.920
that bloke, all happening at the

08:10.120 --> 08:14.920
same time in a tiny terraced house.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.920
Yeah?

08:14.920 --> 08:17.280
Anyway, this interview, right...

08:17.280 --> 08:18.560
How did it go?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.840
It's a small...

08:19.840 --> 08:22.080
PHONE RINGS

08:19.840 --> 08:22.080
Sorry, Malcolm. Can I? Sorry.

08:22.080 --> 08:26.400
They wanted to talk "Tom",

08:22.080 --> 08:26.400
and I said that he was the best MAN

08:22.080 --> 08:26.400
for the job.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.480
Yeah. Well, so what, it's the BBC,
it's not fucking Spare Rib, is it?

08:30.480 --> 08:33.720
I thought it might sound like I was
the best woman for the job.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.320
No offence, but you're not
leadership material.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.000
I mean, fucking cut the material in

08:36.320 --> 08:39.000
that outfit, but you know.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.640
Right.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.640
The BBC have put it on the website...

08:41.640 --> 08:44.400
You saying that the PM's the best
man for the job.

08:44.400 --> 08:48.760
And they're saying that you fired
the starter pistol
on a new leadership bid.

08:48.760 --> 08:49.880
I've got it here. "Absolutely."

08:49.880 --> 08:53.800
"At some point, I would love there
to be a female leader, but I believe

08:53.800 --> 08:57.880
"that the current prime minister is
absolutely the best man for
the job."

08:57.880 --> 09:01.160
No. I said "person"
and you went "huh" over it.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.360
This is bad.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.440
It wasn't on a microphone.
I know that.

09:04.440 --> 09:10.080
Terri, get on to the BBC, fucking
nuke them, nuke them and rebuke
them. Yeah. Got it.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
Malcolm, maybe we're making matters

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
worse.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.480
We're making them think
we've got a live one.
I just think we're overreacting.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.520
No. No. No. No. No.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.640
We nip this in the fucking knackers

09:16.520 --> 09:19.640
now. OK.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.520
It's been a wonderful experience.
I'll leave you to it.
My work here is done.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.960
You're staying here, mate.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.800
I'm not... You haven't even got
biscuits.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.480
You stay here, right.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.440
The situation is fucking febrile.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.640
You don't fucking know what
febrile means. No. You don't.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.200
It means there are going to be
hysterical journalists watching
every fucking move we make.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.320
So why don't you unplug from

09:39.200 --> 09:42.320
the mains until the danger's passed?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.960
There's a few journalists
out there already.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.560
See, there you are.
It's a fucking feeding frenzy.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.920
Yeah. Well, not in here, it's not.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.680
Don't panic, Orca,
we'll get sandwiches. OK.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.040
How many are there there? Eight.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.400
Right. Eight constitutes a lockdown.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.400
Right, people, listen up.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.280
It's a fucking lockdown...right now.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.440
Come off it.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.440
We're not in a prison drama, are we?

10:03.440 --> 10:06.560
We are in a prison drama. This is
The fucking Shawshank Redemption

10:06.560 --> 10:09.600
but with more tunnelling through
shit and no fucking redemption.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.560
Right, people, nobody move.
Nobody move.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.880
Nobody gets truncheoned in the face.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.560
This is a lockdown. Right.

10:15.560 --> 10:19.120
What that means is this office is
now an isolation unit.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.520
Do not use the phones.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.920
No fucking e-mails. No phones, Glen,

10:20.520 --> 10:23.920
come on.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.400
I've got to go. Bye.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.200
Terri. Yes. I'm here.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.680
Get on the phone to the fucking BBC.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.680
Come on.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.000
Everybody else, stay Chaplin.
Is that trainers she's wearing?

10:33.000 --> 10:38.560
You're wearing fucking trainers,

10:33.000 --> 10:38.560
you're supposed to be a civil

10:33.000 --> 10:38.560
servant, not a playgroup assistant.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.800
Steve, oh, the man himself.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.840
Yes. What is it?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.600
It's like wet play, isn't it?

10:50.600 --> 10:52.440
Queen to knight four.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.760
I never had you down as a chess man,
Glenn. I thought you might be more

10:55.760 --> 10:57.400
the kind to play Ludo, or something.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.520
Do you mind?

10:58.520 --> 11:01.160
Oh, what, can you not multitask?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.480
What, check? Oh. Fuck you.

11:03.480 --> 11:09.040
You know, politics is like a game of
chess, Glenn, in so far as you're
shit at both of them.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.840
Excuse me.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.960
Arh, that's what we need, yes.
The one-man smarmy army.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.080
Malcolm, is it George Alagiah?

11:17.080 --> 11:19.400
What? Fuck, it's George Alagiah.
Is he here for me?

11:19.400 --> 11:23.120
What? George Alagiah's here for me.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.120
I could lose everything now.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.760
They'll dig out that picture of me
at the sports day

11:25.760 --> 11:28.680
looking like Catweazle with learning

11:25.760 --> 11:28.680
difficulties.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.720
Nicola Murray will, today, use
a policy speech to announce
her candidancy.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.840
Nicola Murray is not going to

11:32.720 --> 11:36.840
make a leadership announcement this

11:32.720 --> 11:36.840
evening.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.880
Permission to speak,
frankly and off the record? Yeah.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.240
She's an idiot.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.680
I know that she's in the cabinet
but that's like being disabled at
a football match.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.080
She's very close to the action
but hardly likely to score a goal.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.120
No. How is that offensive?

11:53.120 --> 11:58.680
That is a very fair
and accurate portrayal of just how
fucking retarded she is.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.520
I bet you're really enjoying this.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.520
You haven't had this much fun since

11:58.680 --> 12:03.520
you went to Cadbury World.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.280
Come on, Nicola, you've got
to admit, from the outside it's
pretty funny.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.240
The prime minister goes away
and you're dressed up as
one of the ThunderCats.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.040
CONVERTS LAUGH TO A COUGH

12:13.040 --> 12:16.440
It's awful, some of the things
people write on these comments.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.240
They are...
It's so cruel, isn't it?

12:19.240 --> 12:23.000
"Nicola Murray is staging
a leadership bid. Who is
Nicola Murray?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.560
"I have literally never heard of her.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.560
She doesn't exist.

12:26.560 --> 12:31.520
"I would rather cut off my hands
than vote for that disgrace.

12:31.520 --> 12:36.640
"Does anyone else here think
she looks like Heath Ledger in
The Dark Knight?"

12:36.640 --> 12:38.400
Are you e-mailing?

12:38.400 --> 12:41.680
Are you stirring this up? Is that
why you came in to DoSAC today?

12:41.680 --> 12:44.200
Did you have a big bucket
of shit and a whisk?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.800
No.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.240
Yes. A bit.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.160
What are you saying? Just...
Joan Rivers wants to be
the new prime minister.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.200
Have a look at this
clip of her online staking her bid.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.840
You treacherous shit. It's not my
fault you're dressed up like
a dead geisha.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.320
Why are you doing this?

12:59.320 --> 13:05.680
Because I'm bored, it's funny and
I hate you. The holy trinity of why.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.440
Do you know, talking to you is like

13:05.680 --> 13:09.440
talking to a fucking whoopee

13:05.680 --> 13:09.440
cushion.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.640
Right. Bit of good news.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.720
What? Two bits, actually.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.920
Enough. Can we all just shut the
fuck up, OK, so we can gather
our thoughts.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.880
So, one at a time, Private Godfrey,

13:17.920 --> 13:20.880
get to your station.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.840
I want to hear the word
on the street.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.640
All right. Ben has been seen coming
into DoSAC but not going out.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.400
Possibly Ben is her running mate
as number two in a leadership bid.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.120
I don't mind going out there now
and telling them all

13:33.120 --> 13:36.160
just how much I hate Nicola and how
unlikely that is to happen.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.680
And get myself a sandwich.
I'm fucking starving.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.200
What did I just fucking say? I said
one at a fucking time, stand up.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.320
I'm telling you to stand up,
you sack of fucking cum.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.080
Stand the fuck up.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.880
Fucking move. Right.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.200
See that.
Fucking play with that. Right?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.760
Never mind your fucking toys.
Play with that.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.440
Go and stand in that fucking corner.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.320
Stand over there. Right?

14:03.320 --> 14:08.920
And do not move...or I will perform

14:03.320 --> 14:08.920
a fucking living fucking autopsy on

14:03.320 --> 14:08.920
you...

14:08.920 --> 14:13.040
with a fucking rusty spade, I'll
have your kidneys for fucking
cufflinks.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.840
Terri, good news, I believe.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.840
You are about to tell us some good
fucking news. What the fuck is it?

14:19.840 --> 14:25.320
Right. Yeah. OK. Well, according to
my online tracker, the pizza is here.

14:25.320 --> 14:30.040
And the second bit is that the Mail
is backing Nicola's leadership bid

14:30.040 --> 14:34.040
because of the stand she's taken
against shoddy journalism at the BBC.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.320
What?
No wonder George Alagiah's here.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.040
He'll probably come at me with
a fucking Stanley knife.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.800
I knew this would happen. I actually

14:39.040 --> 14:42.800
fucking said this would happen,

14:39.040 --> 14:42.800
Malcolm.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.960
What do we do now?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.880
Hello. Say something.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.400
MOBILE RINGS

14:50.400 --> 14:52.320
Oh, Steve. Hi, there.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.280
I'm going to slip into
a diabetic coma at this rate.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.000
MOBILE RINGS

14:57.000 --> 14:59.640
Better take this elsewhere.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.800
Ben, you don't have
your magic drawer any more.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.320
I think I might. What? I think I do.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.160
It's been four months, Ben.
It can't still be there.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.160
Who's going to know? I've hidden
it under... Well, I know.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.720
Get in!
Sweet giver of blood sugar.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.480
Right. I'm going to go down,
personally, and pick
up the pizza myself.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.000
Can you do savoury after sweet?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.920
Yes. Right. OK.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.960
Tom is as mad as a dickless dog.
Right?

15:23.960 --> 15:27.560
He is specifically very,
very fucking angry at you, Nicola.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.600
Oh, fantastic(!)

15:28.600 --> 15:30.360
Then we should cancel tonight.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.480
Tonight. What's tonight?

15:31.480 --> 15:34.560
It's the fourth sector. 
It's my fourth sector launch.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.400
He's going down to the room.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.760
Just... Just fucking...

15:37.760 --> 15:39.560
One at a time. Right?

15:39.560 --> 15:42.960
Terri, get the minister's car.
Downstairs. Right now.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.080
Why? Never mind fucking why.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.440
Just fucking do it, Holly Golightly.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.440
Come on.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.480
Nicola, I want you to go down
there and I want you to pretend

15:50.480 --> 15:54.160
that you've got an appointment to go
to and this is what you say. Right?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.840
Say? You are not challenging Tom,
at all.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.000
Oh, fuck.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.040
Tom is the man to lead the country
through this difficult crisis.
Right?

16:02.040 --> 16:03.600
Tom is the man of the moment.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.400
Then you get in your car and
you just fucking drive about,

16:06.400 --> 16:09.720
do some sightseeing, attach a
hosepipe to the exhaust, whatever.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.040
Nicola Murray is fucking coming. OK?

16:12.040 --> 16:15.360
See you.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.360
Get me a fucking Curly Wurly. Right?

16:15.360 --> 16:17.760
Would you like a bit of concealer?
No. No!

16:17.760 --> 16:20.760
This is it. It'll work. Get out
there. He's the man of the moment.

16:20.760 --> 16:21.320
You've got the confidence.
That's it.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.920
He's the man of the moment.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.240
Look at that gait. That's fucking
class. Nicola Murray is back.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.920
She's back. She's back on track.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.000
It's a classic Curly Wurly I wanted.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.520
A Curly Wurly should be the size of
a small ladder. Your hands have got
bigger.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.080
I'm going for it. OK.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.080
ALL CLAMOUR: Mrs Murray.
Mrs Murray. Mrs Murray.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.320
Does the prime minister have
your full support?

16:41.320 --> 16:43.640
He absolutely does. Yes. 

16:43.640 --> 16:45.680
Does Mr Cullen have your
support, too?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.000
Yes. Sorry, what?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.640
Glenn Cullen. Do you
know his campaign to be an MP?

16:49.640 --> 16:51.920
'I don't know what that's about.'

16:51.920 --> 16:55.240
I'm backing...
I'm backing the prime minister.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.040
The prime minister is absolutely the
right man for the moment. Thank you.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.640
Not for the moment! That's the worst
possible thing that you could say.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.560
Terry, get the dozy giblet back in
here. Get her back in here.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.720
Don't let her get in the car.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.119
Malcolm wants you back out there.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.640
Shit.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.680
I've got pizza in there.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.720
Thank you. Thank you.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.720
Have you changed your mind? Does he
have your full backing?

17:14.720 --> 17:18.119
Yes. The prime minister, as I said,
is the right man for the moment.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.000
Not again.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.680
NOISE OF MEDIA SCRUM CONTINUES

17:22.680 --> 17:24.920
First-class media work, there.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.240
Pizza!

17:27.240 --> 17:30.360
That's good. Well done.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.000
That was utterly humiliating.
For fuck's sake, Malcolm.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.960
Shouldn't that be of fuck's sake.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.800
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.040
May I just quote it to you.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.440
"The prime minister
is the right man FOR the moment."

17:40.440 --> 17:41.520
That's what you told me to say.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.800
"OF the moment." "OF the moment."

17:42.800 --> 17:45.240
I told you to say
OF the fucking moment.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.800
There's a huge difference between me

17:45.240 --> 17:47.800
saying to you,

17:47.800 --> 17:50.840
"Nicola, I would like to go FOR
a lovely walk with you,"

17:50.840 --> 17:55.400
and, "Nicola, I would like to make a
hat out OF your fucking entrails."

17:55.400 --> 17:57.080
Excuse me.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.320
Steven.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.280
Yes. Well, you can tell Tom,

18:00.280 --> 18:03.280
right now, that I'm fucking
sweating embryos for him. OK.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.360
Glenn, here's a thing. Apparently,
you're going to be an MP.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.880
You didn't talk to me about that.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.000
He's not standing, don't be silly.
Tell her. Put her out of her misery.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.160
Go on. Tell me more. Terri, can I
just get a word in?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.560
Look at this, takeaway and a fight.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.720
All I need now is a hand job in a
bus shelter,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.520
I've had the great
British night out.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.040
Excuse me. I'm off for a doze.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.360
Nicola, I know we're not allowed to
take any calls

18:22.360 --> 18:23.960
but this is your husband.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.280
Thank you.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.240
James. Do you actually
even know me, James?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.080
Do you even know who I am?

18:30.080 --> 18:33.760
I think it's shut-up time, now,
James. So, one last thing.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.320
When I promised to love,
honour and obey you,

18:36.320 --> 18:38.920
it was a massive practical joke.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.040
Hi. Yes.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.680
Sorry, Nicola. Just a quick cup of
coffee. How was your husband?

18:45.680 --> 18:48.160
Sounds a bit upset, is he?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.080
Upset? No. He wants me to stand.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.800
He thinks this is fucking great.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.960
He just wants to show off about
me to the rugby club dinner.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.000
"Hello, everybody. This
is my wife, the prime minister."

18:58.000 --> 19:00.600
"Hello, JB. Have you met my
wife, the prime minister?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.440
"How's your wife, the little lady?"

19:02.440 --> 19:03.920
It's nice that he's being supportive.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.800
He's not being supportive.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.520
James is...he is not
a supporting wall.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.280
He is a partition and I'm going
to have him knocked through.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.320
Nicola, I'm going to
take off my media hat.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.480
I honestly never
thought you had one.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.320
Have you thought about
couples' counselling?

19:21.320 --> 19:23.200
Urghh.

19:23.200 --> 19:28.760
Yes. Look. James will not
go to Relate and

19:28.760 --> 19:30.840
even if he did, George Alagiah would

19:30.840 --> 19:34.720
be outside with a big News 24
cup pressed against the wall.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.440
Well, you know, it can work wonders.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.840
Can it? OK.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.160
You're speaking from
experience, are you?

19:43.160 --> 19:46.480
Well, I mean, I keep my professional
life very, very separate

19:46.480 --> 19:48.040
from my home life, obviously.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.280
Yeah.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.000
I always say what goes
on behind my front door

19:52.000 --> 19:55.040
stays behind my front door.
That is my motto. So... Yeah.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.920
My motto would be...

19:58.920 --> 20:01.680
could I have another cup of coffee,

19:58.920 --> 20:01.680
Terri?

20:01.680 --> 20:04.240
Well, I did just bring you a cup.

20:04.240 --> 20:07.000
I got that one, registered
that and would love another one.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.760
It's just that kind of a day.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.720
Right.
Where's Hale and Pacemaker?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.800
Who? Glenn and fucking Ollie.
Where are they?

20:12.800 --> 20:13.840
I don't know.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
I need them back here,
anyway, for the launch.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.240
For the launch.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.200
The launch. The fourth...the fourth

20:19.200 --> 20:21.240
The fourth sector launch, Malcolm.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.360
Jesus, you're about as on the ball
today as a dead seal.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.200
That's one of my fucking lines.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.320
There is a launch party tonight,
a load of press are coming and I

20:29.320 --> 20:32.520
haven't even started my speech.
I don't know how to start my speech.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.800
Just start with a joke, you know.
They all like a joke.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.400
I'll start with a joke.
Great advice. Thanks, Malcolm.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.960
Malcolm, this launch, is it
something that should really happen?

20:41.960 --> 20:44.160
We can't cancel it, can we?
But she can't do it.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.000
There's no fucking way
that she can do it.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.040
It's too fucking...

20:47.040 --> 20:50.080
We'll have to get a stunt double.
Ben.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.200
Ben. Yes.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.200
He can do it in drag. It'll be fine.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.640
Nicola's been looking like a fucking

20:54.200 --> 20:56.640
tranny, anyway.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.840
I really don't think
that's a good idea, Malcolm.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.320
Terri, I thought we had a deal.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.440
Right. When I need your advice,
I'll give you the special signal

21:03.440 --> 21:06.440
which is me being sectioned under
the fucking Mental Health Act.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.680
Ben, let me help you.
What about some make-up?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.480
No. I don't want any of your bloody

21:08.680 --> 21:10.480
make-up.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.040
Are you on commission
or something?

21:12.040 --> 21:14.720
Right. Well, that's it.
That's my fourth sector speech.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.080
Not so fast.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.480
I'm sorry, Nicola, but...

21:17.480 --> 21:19.360
no, no, you're not doing the launch.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.640
I can't have you launching things
at this moment in time. Come on.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.080
I have to do this.
Who else is going to launch it?

21:25.080 --> 21:27.680
Ben is going to be announcing
the fourth sector...

21:27.680 --> 21:28.760
No. No. No. No. No. Yes.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.000
Although it might be difficult to
smash a champagne bottle on a turd.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.600
Just let me try and communicate here.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.040
Malcolm, it's hard for me to
say this, but I'm afraid...

21:39.040 --> 21:43.480
the thing is, a lot of calls
you've made today, they've been

21:43.480 --> 21:46.360
off, wrong, not the right calls.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.240
OK. I'll give you some examples cos
I can see that that's tough.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.520
OK. First one, you didn't even send
that email. It was still in drafts.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.400
OK. Then secondly, it
was you that told me to

21:57.400 --> 21:59.080
make that big attack on the BBC.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.440
And I'm afraid we did look silly

22:01.440 --> 22:04.440
running around outside,
getting in and out of a car.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.800
Look, Malcolm, I know that Steve
Fleming's come back on the scene.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.640
Are you feeling emasculated by that?

22:10.640 --> 22:15.600
It's like you're a Catherine Wheel
and you fell off the stick.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.120
You're going...
but not in the right way.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.320
I think you're wrong, Malcolm.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.760
You're like a sultana in a salad.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.360
Terri, can we have a word?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.000
How fucking dare you?

22:44.000 --> 22:47.680
Have you any idea
of the amount of pressure

22:47.680 --> 22:49.920
that has been exerted on my skull?

22:49.920 --> 22:53.000
It feels like my brain has been
fucking emptied into little packets,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.080
into crisp packets.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.120
Cheese and onion fucking crisp
packets

22:56.120 --> 22:59.000
that contain my living,
breathing fucking brain.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Malcolm, I'm really sorry, I...

23:01.000 --> 23:04.840
And these crisp packets,
cheese and onion, smoky bacon,

23:04.840 --> 23:07.120
they've been stomped on.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.160
They've been fucking stomped on.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.800
Ben, fucking...Nicola.

23:10.800 --> 23:11.840
I didn't mean to be horrid.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.000
And fucking you.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.680
I'm sorry.

23:18.680 --> 23:19.960
I'm sorry.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.000
I'm sorry.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.040
I'm sorry.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.120
No. I'm over it. OK.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.560
Don't you apologise.
Don't you fucking apologise.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.400
You don't need to apologise.
I love this place, I do.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.720
I mean, fucking compared to No 10,
this place is fucking tranquil.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.080
Yeah.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.560
Over there, 300 yards down the road,
it's like a fucking cancer ward.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.440
There are people who are
fucking screaming at each other.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.240
They're screaming, "You gave me this

23:39.440 --> 23:42.240
fucking disease."

23:42.240 --> 23:44.040
"You gave me this fucking disease."

23:44.040 --> 23:47.280
And every corner that I turn,
there's another threat, Terri.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.440
Hacks, hacks, fucking vampire hacks.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.440
And they're slaughtering us, Terri,

23:52.440 --> 23:56.120
they're fucking slaughtering us and
they want my face for a flannel.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.720
And you know what, I used to be
the fucking pharaoh, Terri.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.760
I used to be a fucking pharaoh.

24:02.960 --> 24:06.760
Now I'm fucking floundering in a
Nile of shit.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.840
But I am going to fashion
a paddle out of that shit. Yeah.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.160
Mmm. Good idea.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.680
I'm not going down.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.120
I am not going down. Yeah?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.080
Yeah.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.120
How are you feeling about things?

24:22.120 --> 24:25.880
Well, you know, I'm just trying to do
my best and you know, make sure I can

24:25.880 --> 24:28.880
still get home by six o'clock.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.920
Do you want a hug?

24:29.920 --> 24:33.320
No. No. I think... that's nice of
you. I really appreciate it.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.920
Terri, it's been nice to have
a chat but I've got to get on.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.120
OK. Yeah.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.320
Let's get back on track,
as they say.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.040
All right. OK, Nicola.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.840
See you in your office, please.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.440
What did he say?

24:47.440 --> 24:50.200
Don't know.
It was all about ancient Egypt.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.240
Ancient Egypt. Yeah.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.640
The fourth sector. What is
the fourth sector, you seem to ask?

24:56.640 --> 24:59.120
A good question.
That's a really good question.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.640
I reply. Well, let's start at the...

25:04.400 --> 25:07.520
Ben is doing the best he can.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.800
Is he?

25:08.800 --> 25:12.680
There are four...the fourth.
There are four sectors.

25:12.680 --> 25:18.440
Imagine that a cake that has been cut
into four slices.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.800
The cake of good hope.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.240
Malcolm? Don't go for it.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.320
Yes. Yes.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.040
Are you sure that's wise? Cover me.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.080
No. No!

25:32.320 --> 25:34.160
Nicola, no. Nicola, no!

25:36.640 --> 25:39.600
...a valuable, a valuable
contribution to society

25:39.600 --> 25:41.920
with all four sectors of the cake.

25:41.920 --> 25:46.960
And here is Nicola Murray
to tell you...to tell you more.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.360
Nicola Murray.

25:48.360 --> 25:54.040
Hello. Hi. No need to stand,
as the PM said to me this morning.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.760
A colleague of mine said you
should always start with a joke.

25:57.760 --> 26:02.320
One other thing, just about earlier
on with the thing with the car,

26:02.320 --> 26:03.840
that was all a bit odd.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.800
The explanation is I suffer from
carsickness and sometimes

26:06.800 --> 26:09.720
I get ill
even in a stationary car.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.320
I actually once threw up
watching an edition of Top Gear,

26:13.320 --> 26:16.760
but that was chiefly because I
don't like Jeremy Paxman, Clark...

26:16.760 --> 26:18.920
Clarkson, isn't it?

26:18.920 --> 26:22.280
Anyway, the fourth sector is
something I feel very passionate

26:22.280 --> 26:24.640
about so let me try and
explain it to you.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.600
I don't know if Ben's talked to you
about the cake image.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.880
Let's imagine I'm a mum, cos I am,

26:29.880 --> 26:32.800
and I'm trying
to bake a cake for my children.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.360
And my aim is to bake a cake
that actually can consume itself

26:37.360 --> 26:40.120
cos that in a sense is what
the fourth sector is doing.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.000
We're baking a self-eating cake.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.320
I've put in a couple of other things

26:43.000 --> 26:46.320
which I can't quite read

26:46.320 --> 26:50.160
because I wrote them in a hurry, so
the point is, this leaflet tells you

26:50.160 --> 26:51.240
all you need to know.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.080
Actually, you don't need me
wittering so help yourself

26:54.080 --> 26:56.200
to the literature,
help yourself to...

26:56.200 --> 26:58.840
we haven't got a cake,
cos it's eaten itself...

26:58.840 --> 27:01.680
but we have got nuts.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.760
Sorry, we haven't got any nuts,
we've just got Skips.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.680
We've got no nuts.
DoSAC has no nuts.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.760
There's a headline.
Please don't use it.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.440
Sorry I missed it. Did it go well?

27:14.440 --> 27:15.560
No.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.480
Well, more good news.

27:18.480 --> 27:24.240
I'm afraid my chances of becoming
an MP have been torpedoed

27:24.240 --> 27:26.680
by the U-boat that was you.

27:26.680 --> 27:31.480
The selection committee decided that
my association

27:31.480 --> 27:33.320
with you was too divisive.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.440
The dream is over, eh?

27:35.440 --> 27:38.600
I'm devastated. I had 500 quid on
you being the new Foreign Secretary.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.200
It's a great loss to
regional politics, for sure.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.760
By flying so close to your bright
sun, like Icarus,

27:44.760 --> 27:47.680
I have crashed to the earth and died.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.280
Nicola, I've got to tell
you that was one of the best

27:50.280 --> 27:51.960
live performances I've ever seen.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.560
I've seen fucking Stomp.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.040
It was a consummate piece of
fucking incompetence.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.240
Yeah. That's what I thought I'd do.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.240
Take the heat off.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.280
The blog's updating.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.800
Am I still leadership contender?

28:04.800 --> 28:07.360
No. Not at all.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.360
Well, good. Good.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.280
Not even an outsider. No.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.200
What are they saying?

28:14.200 --> 28:17.560
You don't really want to know
what they're saying. Not exactly.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.600
Sorry.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.640
What a fucking day.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
the DoSAC protest is now over.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.640
Please mop up your shit
and fuck off.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.040
Good news.
The BBC's going to issue an apology

28:29.040 --> 28:30.760
for the way they edited the video.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.720
There you are.
The BB Fucking C. Yeah.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.280
I mean, they crumble at
the first sign of pressure,

28:35.280 --> 28:36.520
like an old woman's hip.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.240
That's why they had a fucking
programme called Sorry.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.000
Right. The PM is coming home early.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.400
He's asked for an audience
with Senor Malcolm Tucker,

28:44.400 --> 28:46.200
so I'm getting my paddle, Terri.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.360
I'm getting my paddle.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.880
Make sure fucking
Nicola doesn't top herself, eh.

28:49.880 --> 28:50.920
Yeah. Sure.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.080
Make sure Ben does.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.560
Oh, and Glenn, Glenn, I've got a
very special task for you,

28:55.560 --> 28:56.680
my unelectable friend.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.040
What's that?

28:58.040 --> 29:00.440
Turn the fucking phones back on.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.880
Night, Malcolm.
