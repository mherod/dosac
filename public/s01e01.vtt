WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:04.960
Thank you.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.400
Morning.

00:06.400 --> 00:12.440
This programme contains
very strong language.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.320
Morning, Cliff, let me take that.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.320
Thank you.

00:15.320 --> 00:20.840
Up all night
with these bloody things.
At a time like this, for God's sake!

00:20.840 --> 00:25.400
Going to have a pizza. Have you got

00:20.840 --> 00:25.400
the digest, please? ..Thank you.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.000
Um...

00:27.000 --> 00:31.240
Would you mind taking them? Oh, why?
Um, Malcolm's there.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.720
Malcolm? Where? In there? In there.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.720
Why?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.320
It's just a social call.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.560
A social call? Jesus Christ! Yeah.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.600
Um...have you got him coffee?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.800
Did you get him coffee?

00:43.800 --> 00:46.800
I thought you were organising it.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.800
Oh, for Christ...

00:46.800 --> 00:53.040
Get coffee, get, um, danish pastries,
croissants and... Danish pastries,

00:46.800 --> 00:53.040
croissants... No, no, no!

00:53.040 --> 00:57.840
Fruit! Get lots of fruit. Can you

00:53.040 --> 00:57.840
get fruit? A pile of fruit
and lots of coffee. Now! OK?

00:59.080 --> 01:01.360
He's useless.

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
He's absolutely useless! He is!

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
He's useless! He's as useless as

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
a marzipan dildo.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.720
I've got to go.
The minister's just walked in.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.000
Don't interrupt your call because of
me. You're a minister of the Crown.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.440
You don't need to listen
to all of my chutney!

01:16.440 --> 01:19.240
I'm sure it's much, much
more interesting than chutney.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.960
No, no, no. It's... It's a...

01:20.960 --> 01:26.480
my cock-up, as usual. I thought that
Graham Dixon was doing a briefing,
and it turns out it's Graham Hughes.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.560
Too many Grahams around. We ought to
kill some of them. Exactly!

01:31.520 --> 01:33.120
So... So...

01:33.120 --> 01:36.360
God, look, I'm sorry about the
fuck-up about the coffee. Oh, God...

01:36.360 --> 01:41.800
How am I supposed to run a department
if I can't get the Prime Minister's

01:36.360 --> 01:41.800
enforcer a cup of fucking coffee?

01:41.800 --> 01:43.840
No, no, that's OK.
Listen, the thing is...

01:43.840 --> 01:46.440
you are doing a bloody good job
here, Cliff.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.720
With all this shit in the paper about
whether I'm going or not... Yeah.

01:49.720 --> 01:54.200
Terri, can you bring the Mail in,
please? ..Have you seen the Mail?

01:54.200 --> 01:58.280
Is that "Lawton dangles by a
thread"? Yeah! Dangles by a thread!

01:58.280 --> 02:03.160
It's OK. We've got... Lawton dangles

01:58.280 --> 02:03.160
by a thread? We've got. It's OK. Do
keep it.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.720
Yeah. No, just leave it there.
Thank you, Terri.
There's a lot of them, isn't there?

02:08.720 --> 02:12.480
It started with the Telegraph diary,
but just more and more and more.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.640
Seriously,
the PM likes you personally.

02:15.640 --> 02:22.040
I like you personally, and we've
absolutely no desire to get rid of
you. I just want you to know that.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.079
None of this negative stuff
is coming from us.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.400
Oh, no, mate. That...

02:30.000 --> 02:33.280
..makes a big difference. Makes me
feel a lot more secure. Does it?

02:33.280 --> 02:35.000
Well, it's difficult.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.680
What's difficult? Just endless
headlines, day after day.

02:38.680 --> 02:44.079
It's chipping away at confidence.
Absolutely. The thing is...
we're starting to look weak.

02:44.079 --> 02:47.760
Everybody's saying, "When's
he gonna go. When's he gonna go?"

02:48.840 --> 02:55.760
Right... And you don't want us
to look weak, do you? No, no...

02:48.840 --> 02:55.760
So there you are!

02:57.400 --> 03:00.200
That's why you've gotta go.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.880
No.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.200
Yes. No.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.200
KNOCK AT DOOR

03:04.200 --> 03:07.240
Would you like some coffee?
Fuck off! Tea?

03:07.240 --> 03:09.440
You fuck off, darling.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.440
Malcolm, look, um...

03:11.440 --> 03:16.040
if you do this, it's the bollocks
of the jungle out there, you know?

03:16.040 --> 03:17.680
They're like wolves...

03:17.680 --> 03:22.120
pissed wolves. I've made the
announcement. I've told the Lobby.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.800
You've told the Lobby I'm going?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.520
Yeah. Sorry, Cliff.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.760
Minister... Yeah, get used to

03:25.520 --> 03:27.760
"Cliff".

03:27.760 --> 03:33.240
I've booked you in for
the usual soapy-tit-wank farewell
at Number 10 in 20 minutes.

03:33.240 --> 03:38.600
I've drafted a letter of
resignation. It says you're jumping
before you're pushed,

03:38.600 --> 03:43.040
although we're going to be briefing
that you were pushed. Sorry.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.720
Um...

03:45.720 --> 03:51.760
Look, you don't need to do all this.
What about Tom, yeah? Everybody
knows he's fucking up Transport.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.640
We can't sack Tom at Transport!
We can't lose anyone at Transport,
they're important!

03:56.640 --> 03:58.480
What, and Social Affairs isn't?

03:58.480 --> 04:03.920
Oh... OK, the Department of
Social Affairs is very important,
but it's not Transport.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.120
Transport's cars, buses, trucks...

04:06.120 --> 04:09.080
I know what Transport
fucking entails!

04:09.080 --> 04:11.600
Look, look...

04:12.880 --> 04:15.520
HUGH SIGHS DEEPLY

04:15.520 --> 04:17.000
I'll look at them.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.279
"Personal reasons"?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.400
Yeah. I thought that would
give you adequate scope. Scope?

04:24.400 --> 04:28.640
What like, um, shooting up in the
Cabinet office or something? What?

04:28.640 --> 04:34.840
Stuffing a cat up my arse and having
a wank? What do you mean? You know,

04:28.640 --> 04:34.840
this could be a great deal worse.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.320
You have had a good innings.
You have been here for 18 months

04:39.320 --> 04:45.960
and, you know, I have written
some very nice things about you in
the PM's reply to your resignation.

04:45.960 --> 04:51.640
Some very nice fucking things
indeed! I had a lump in my throat,
and you know why?

04:51.640 --> 04:58.360
Because no-one who matters thinks
any the less of you over this...

04:51.640 --> 04:58.360
SO FAR, OK?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.600
Right, one more thing.
The Daily Mail.

05:03.600 --> 05:09.400
David Topham has got it into his
head that we are going to sack you

05:03.600 --> 05:09.400
because of Press pressure.

05:09.400 --> 05:15.400
I wonder why(!)
Look, you're in no position to dish
out fucking sarcasm, that's over.

05:15.400 --> 05:21.960
You no longer have purchase in the
sarcasm world! Get on the phone,

05:15.400 --> 05:21.960
tell them that you're jumping

05:21.960 --> 05:28.520
before you are pushed. We were
going to push you because of your
deeply-held fucking personal issues!

05:29.560 --> 05:31.600
You want me to write my own obituary?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.760
Get on the fucking phone!

05:33.760 --> 05:35.000
Do it now!

05:40.520 --> 05:42.040
Morning!

05:48.200 --> 05:53.560
Good morning. Have you seen the

05:48.200 --> 05:53.560
Times? No. Jo Cherman. She's been
a bit of a bitch, actually.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.400
Well, she always is. Yeah.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.760
Everything in this package is small!
We'll go down, the local yokels
will take photographs

05:59.760 --> 06:02.920
and that's fine. They'll snap away
for 20... 20 minutes is enough.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.920
He's here now, so don't worry.
Morning, Hugh!

06:05.920 --> 06:08.360
Good morning. Come on!

06:08.360 --> 06:13.320
Terri, shush! I've got something
very important to say. I've got...

06:13.320 --> 06:17.800
Olly, I've got something for us.
I got us a very tasty little morsel,

06:17.800 --> 06:25.000
because I had a chat with my very
good friend the Prime Minister of
Great Britain... Oh, really? Oh?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes, and remember the, um...

06:28.120 --> 06:31.680
Olly, your benefit unit fraud...

06:31.680 --> 06:33.920
Anti-Benefit Fraud Executive - ABFE.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.600
ABFE? Um, Scrounger Squad...

06:36.600 --> 06:40.520
Snooper Squad. Snooper Squad! The
one with spending implications? Yes.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.560
The Prime Minister's view is,
"Fuck the spending implications,
I like it."

06:44.560 --> 06:46.800
Good.
So this is us, we're on the map.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.480
It's a chance for me, Glenn, to get
on Richard And Judy and plant that

06:46.800 --> 06:53.480
flag right on their fucking sofa.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.760
So the Prime Minister's
authorised you to announce it?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.960
Well, that's very much

06:56.760 --> 06:59.960
what he signalled, yes, very clearly.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.120
He said he's right behind us
and it's what we should be doing.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.280
This is great. So we can do it this
afternoon at the school, can't we?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.920
We can clear the press conference
and... Excuse me.

07:09.920 --> 07:16.800
Yeah, we'll double-bubble it. Yeah?
We'll leak it to the Standard, then
trail it on The World At One, yes?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.120
We need someone at the Standard...

07:19.120 --> 07:24.000
What about Angela Heaney? She's at
the Standard now, isn't she? Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.720
Yeah, Olly?

07:25.720 --> 07:29.520
Um, yes, she is. Do you not think
that maybe she's a bit junior?

07:29.520 --> 07:34.840
A bit too much like your ex, who
broke your heart then dumped you

07:29.520 --> 07:34.840
with a text message?

07:34.840 --> 07:40.080
It was a fucking e-mail! It wasn't
a text message. She'll write
what we want. She's easy.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.960
She's easy. Yeah, she is easy.

07:41.960 --> 07:46.200
I can see that you've all got big,
stiff hard-ons for this... Sorry?

07:46.200 --> 07:50.040
That is nice. I'm not saying
that's not nice but... Terri?

07:50.040 --> 07:54.840
..there is no way we'll clear it
by this afternoon so... Why not?

07:54.840 --> 07:58.440
Cool it. I'll ring Paul
at the Treasury. No! No, no!

07:58.440 --> 08:00.400
No phone calls to the Treasury!

08:00.400 --> 08:07.320
If you call the Treasury, he's
going to have to dress up as
catering with a big tray of drinks

08:07.320 --> 08:10.240
and a pot of sliced lemons... I'm

08:07.320 --> 08:10.240
not doing that. They'll just take it.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.800
I'm just going by procedure.

08:11.800 --> 08:17.120
Terri, I love doing things
the right way, that ethical stuff,
I love it, we all do,

08:17.120 --> 08:21.440
but it's very difficult when you're
the first person to put the gun down,

08:21.440 --> 08:26.720
because people tend to jump on your
head as if it's a ripe watermelon.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.720
We don't want that, do we? OK.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.720
The Prime Minister is
above the Treasury in the hierarchy.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.200
I can write it down on a chart.
Whatever. Thank you.

08:33.200 --> 08:38.640
Very good, Minister, I'll get to it.
Yeah. You're just doing your job.
Yeah. (Not very well.)

08:38.640 --> 08:43.240
Will you get Angela on the phone
for Olly? ..You can deal with this,

08:38.640 --> 08:43.240
Olly, yes? Um...

08:43.240 --> 08:48.800
Thanks. The driver. ..Technically.
Yeah. Will it be my driver? Yes.
I don't fucking like him. Why not?

08:48.800 --> 08:52.080
He's... I don't know.
I think he despises me.

08:52.080 --> 08:58.120
We'll have to use him today, because
you know how the pool system works.
So we go down to the school, um...

08:58.120 --> 09:00.720
He's sort of contemptuous.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.960
The driver?
I feel like he looks down on me.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.920
No. Hugh he likes you, I'm sure.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.880
PIPS ON CAR RADIO

09:08.880 --> 09:14.440
'The World At One, this is
Nick Clarke with 30 minutes of
news and...' You can fuck off!

09:14.440 --> 09:17.960
'This afternoon the Social Affairs
Secretary, Hugh Abbot...' Evening!

09:17.960 --> 09:23.400
First story up. '..Funding for
an anti-fraud executive to include
a uniformed so-called Snooper Force.

09:23.400 --> 09:28.320
'The announcement suggests the DSA
has pushed the Treasury
into releasing more funds,

09:28.320 --> 09:32.320
'so is the Treasury losing its
central policy?' Not before time!

09:32.320 --> 09:37.040
'We'll talk to Opposition spokesman,
Mark Davis Nathenson...'
If you can get him out of the bath.

09:37.040 --> 09:43.280
'First, estimates of fatalities
from yesterday's train disaster in
Bangalore have risen overnight...'

09:43.280 --> 09:46.560
That's marvellous.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.560
MOBILE RINGS

09:46.560 --> 09:48.600
Oh, Tucker. ..Malcolm.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.600
What the fuck was that? Was this
whole Snooper Force thing from you?

09:52.600 --> 09:57.120
I talked to the PM
and this is completely Kosher,
as far he's concerned.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.840
He gave the go ahead and said,
"Bounce the Treasury!"

10:00.840 --> 10:04.760
We've got 17 different issues we're
fighting with the Treasury about!

10:04.760 --> 10:07.880
'I can hear that you are, as usual,
upset...'

10:07.880 --> 10:15.000
I'll tell you why I'm upset. I'm
upset because these fucking morons
over at the Treasury are paranoid!

10:15.000 --> 10:20.760
If you don't tell them about stuff
like this, or cc them an e-mail,
they think you've started a coup!

10:20.760 --> 10:26.720
Malcolm... You don't seem to
understand that I'm going to have to
mop up a fucking hurricane of piss

10:26.720 --> 10:31.520
from all of these neurotics. What
did the Prime Minister actually say?

10:31.520 --> 10:35.520
He said, "This is exactly the
kind of thing we should be doing."

10:35.520 --> 10:37.160
What did he actually say?

10:37.160 --> 10:40.920
He said, "This is exactly the
sort of thing we should be doing."

10:40.920 --> 10:42.960
"Should be doing..."

10:42.960 --> 10:45.440
"Should" does not mean "yes".

10:45.440 --> 10:50.760
There's only one thing to do here,
what I'm going to tell you to do.

10:45.440 --> 10:50.760
Kill it!

10:50.760 --> 10:54.680
I can't kill it. I'm on my way
to make the announcement.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.440
There's gonna be TV cameras there
and everything.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.120
Well, fuck the TV cameras!
Think of something else to say,

11:01.120 --> 11:05.120
but don't mention the Snooper Force
or whatever the fuck you call it!

11:05.120 --> 11:10.000
Scambusters. Get rid of it! I don't

11:05.120 --> 11:10.000
want to hear about it again. Bye!

11:10.000 --> 11:14.400
Hugh, talk to me. Hugh,
what's going on? What's the matter?

11:14.400 --> 11:18.920
We're going to have to do a number of
things... Like? ..almost immediately.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.040
What's the problem? Fuck...

11:21.040 --> 11:26.840
Hugh, what? Stop saying what. Right.
I shouldn't have been sucked in!

11:21.040 --> 11:26.840
Is this Tucker jumping on this?

11:26.840 --> 11:30.560
I think he was right.
He's always fucking right.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.760
No, he's not always right.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.200
Should...

11:34.840 --> 11:36.760
Does it mean "yes"?

11:36.760 --> 11:39.680
Yes, we should do this.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.840
Hugh... When Tucker was talking
to me, "should" didn't mean "yes".

11:43.840 --> 11:45.880
I mean, it really didn't.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.920
I felt like a fool.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.480
This is nice.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.240
Yeah, this is very nice.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.080
This is just work, isn't it?
I mean, we're not...

11:57.080 --> 12:00.360
Yeah, no, absolutely. No, no...
Nothing like that.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.560
It's just, you know, deadline.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.160
Yeah, sure.

12:03.160 --> 12:08.000
Something like, Social Affairs
Minister Hugh Abbot

12:08.000 --> 12:13.680
will today announce a tough new
crackdown on benefit fraudsters...

12:13.680 --> 12:15.640
Um...

12:15.640 --> 12:20.160
paragraph. Yeah, I can
do the punctuation, Olly. Sorry.

12:20.160 --> 12:26.960
Actually, I did have it written down
a bit better. Oh, that's fantastic

12:20.160 --> 12:26.960
Olly. Can I just have that? Sure.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.120
That's great.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.280
It's all... It should all be there.
I've done it in capitals.

12:33.280 --> 12:38.440
Cool? I think I'll say
SENIOR Government sources.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.800
Thank you very much!

12:40.800 --> 12:44.280
It sounds better. Yeah, of course.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.080
Olly! Come on! Over here, Olly!

12:51.480 --> 12:53.120
Sorry.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.960
What's that you've got? Olives.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.760
Olives? Do you want one?
He's brought his own olives.

13:01.760 --> 13:08.760
So the line is, and call every
news desk, that the Snooper Force
story is that it was let out

13:08.760 --> 13:12.600
by "a disgruntled civil servant".
OK?

13:12.600 --> 13:16.920
OK, great. Terri... Mmm?
You can drop that tone, all right?

13:16.920 --> 13:20.360
What tone? The
I-knew-better-all-along tone, yeah?

13:20.360 --> 13:23.560
It isn't fucking appreciated
right now.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.400
Bye.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.000
The thing is,
the story isn't a story...

13:28.000 --> 13:31.640
What do you mean? The Snooper Force.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.640
It's not happening.

13:31.640 --> 13:35.240
None of that is actually happ...
None of that is actually happening.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.480
I-I can't do this.
You've got to do this.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.920
I mean, yeah, you know reading,

13:38.480 --> 13:42.920
talking, I get...I get car sick.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.840
I've got to stop. We've got to stop.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.000
Jesus Christ!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.880
Do you think you could pull in
at the next lay-by?

13:52.640 --> 13:54.800
As far as the department
is concerned...

13:54.800 --> 14:00.400
As far as the Government
is concerned, there is
no Snooper Force. What's going on?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.720
Has the Treasury gone ballistic?
No, no.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.800
Is this flip-flop? No, there's
no flip-flop. Nothing like that...

14:06.800 --> 14:12.080
This isn't a change in policy
in any...in any respect.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.000
No. What's going on ,Olly?

14:15.000 --> 14:21.360
No, well, the truth is that I...
acted beyond my brief.
What are you talking about?

14:21.360 --> 14:26.680
I dunno. I just kind of wanted
to play the big man in front of you.

14:26.680 --> 14:30.240
You came out and you
just made something up? No, no.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.680
I'm really so sorry.
If it's any help...

14:33.680 --> 14:40.280
The line that we're getting is that
there's a disgruntled civil servant.
They leaked the story. Got a name?

14:40.280 --> 14:46.760
Do I have a name for the disgruntled
civil servant? Well, Derek.
Derek Terri...

14:46.760 --> 14:52.880
Terri. No, we're gonna pick a name.
We're gonna pick a name. I'm
so sorry. I'm so sorry about this.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.160
This is ridiculous! No, it's...
Did you plan all of this?

14:56.160 --> 15:02.480
The last thing I want to do today
is be stuck in a fucking lay-by,

14:56.160 --> 15:02.480
begging my ex-girlfriend!

15:05.520 --> 15:09.760
All right. So what the hell
am I going to say

15:09.760 --> 15:15.400
is the reason for me summoning all
the nation's major news organisations

15:15.400 --> 15:18.200
to a school in Wiltshire?

15:18.200 --> 15:23.960
So you want something sexy
and eye-catching and that is free
and universally popular

15:23.960 --> 15:27.960
and instantly applicable, no-one
can possibly object to it? Yeah.

15:27.960 --> 15:33.400
Yes. You should have said something
before, Glenn, because I've got
a file that fucking thick of that

15:33.400 --> 15:37.200
back in the office! Those sorts of
policies are ten a penny! Olly!

15:37.200 --> 15:43.000
Our entire manifesto is made up of
them. It doesn't help when you
get cynical. This as an opportunity.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.640
It's not that easy to come up with
Das Kapital in the back of the cab,

15:43.000 --> 15:48.640
Glenn! Olly. Here. Shave.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.800
What we need is
something that the public want,

15:52.800 --> 15:55.000
is incredibly popular and is free.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.640
Return of capital punishment.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.320
That's a joke, right?
You are joking, yes, obviously?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.440
Come on, Olly.
Come up with something.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.520
National spare room database?

16:08.840 --> 16:11.520
What about zoos?

16:11.520 --> 16:14.360
My kids went to a zoo the other day

16:14.360 --> 16:18.400
and they said it was fucking
disgusting, the state of it.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
That's shit, isn't it?

16:22.640 --> 16:27.960
No... But there is an idea there,
because in the middle of the city

16:22.640 --> 16:27.960
you've got wild animals.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.720
Pet ASBOs. Remember, ASBOs for pets?

16:29.720 --> 16:35.920
That sounds potentially ludicrous,
but then pet passports...
I mean that was a...that was a goer.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.600
What if everybody
had to carry a plastic bag.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.960
By law. You know the identification
cards are coming in...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.600
You've fucking cracked! Are you mad?

16:46.480 --> 16:48.560
What if the announcement is...

16:48.560 --> 16:50.440
there's no big announcement.

16:50.440 --> 16:57.160
Oh... Wait. We say the Department of

16:50.440 --> 16:57.160
Social Affairs has been doing
amazing work, bread-and-butter work,

16:57.160 --> 17:01.000
the kind of work that you people

16:57.160 --> 17:01.000
aren't interested in.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.640
It's not media-friendly stuff.
You're obsessed with how things play
in the media, you sickos. Sickos!

17:06.640 --> 17:13.319
Every time we try and do it, we just
carry on with our day, you don't
show up, so we have to call a big...

17:13.319 --> 17:17.240
Why bread and butter? On target,

17:13.319 --> 17:17.240
under budget... Coal-face politics.

17:17.240 --> 17:21.720
Coal? Absolutely, yes, I like it. Not

17:17.240 --> 17:21.720
wasting resources. Let's do that.

17:21.720 --> 17:27.359
Let's go for that. We trick them

17:21.720 --> 17:27.359
by...a tinselly thing, and they come
along and then we say, "Ah..."

17:27.359 --> 17:33.040
That's what we've been doing! We've
been doing our fucking jobs! Yes,
they never print that stuff, do they?

17:33.040 --> 17:38.720
And you've come all this way. We've
got you two hours out of London
to cover this. You mugs! You mugs!

17:38.720 --> 17:42.280
You've got a bigger story here
than you have chasing your tinsel.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.960
You live in a country which is
properly... There's not
many countries can say that!

17:46.960 --> 17:50.760
And we've probably got
ten million we can throw at it. Yes.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.680
That's good, that,
because it sounds like a lot. Yeah.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.640
I've got a thing here that says
"springy concrete".

17:56.640 --> 18:00.560
I think that's about the playground
but I don't... "Springy concrete"?

18:00.560 --> 18:04.480
Good afternoon. Should I say, "Hello,

18:00.560 --> 18:04.480
boys and girls"? Yes, very nice.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.240
No, it's going out on TV.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.320
It'll look ridiculous if he's on
the six o'clock news
saying, "Hello, boys and girls."

18:11.320 --> 18:14.840
..Real money for real families...

18:11.320 --> 18:14.840
He's not patronising them!

18:14.840 --> 18:17.840
Real families or real people?

18:14.840 --> 18:17.840
Real people! Families!

18:17.840 --> 18:24.840
You see...families. Families sounds
exclusive. It sounds back to basics.

18:17.840 --> 18:24.840
It sounds John Major, so...

18:24.840 --> 18:30.680
"People" sounds communist.
It doesn't! I'll say families.
Thank you. Say "families of people".

18:30.680 --> 18:32.360
Mr Abbot...

18:32.360 --> 18:34.560
Great, you're on, here we go.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.360
It's what you do best, mate. Yeah.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.920
Well, that was a fucking disaster.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.080
Well, that... Shut up.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.320
Thank you.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.880
Ah! Well done.

19:01.880 --> 19:07.320
There's absolutely nothing
in the Standard. Big fat nothing.
Nothing? You've got away with it.

19:07.320 --> 19:12.680
He's created a press conference
so boring that none

19:07.320 --> 19:12.680
of the Press will even touch it.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.880
Fucking well done, mate!
You turned it around.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.360
Well,
you really pulled it round, mate.

19:24.360 --> 19:29.120
I took the flack. You supplied the
flack jacket. And the bullets bounced

19:24.360 --> 19:29.120
off.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.880
This is what it's all about, Glenn.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.600
All those years at the coal-face,
hanging in, taking all the shit.

19:36.600 --> 19:42.440
When you're senior Cabinet minister,
then we'll show them. And Snooper

19:36.600 --> 19:42.440
Force... What? We'll get rid of that.

19:42.440 --> 19:47.000
Oh, for fuck sake, yeah! Fiddling
while Rome burns. Fucking right!

19:47.000 --> 19:51.800
We'll kick some arse, kick some butt!

19:47.000 --> 19:51.800
That's what we're in it for, mate.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.840
Instead of all the shit that we do.
Have to do. It's a means to an end!

19:55.840 --> 19:58.440
Fuck me, Malcolm! How do you do that?

19:58.440 --> 20:01.000
Can I have a word with you?

20:03.760 --> 20:06.040
DOOR SLAMS

20:06.040 --> 20:10.440
MALCOLM SIGHS DEEPLY

20:06.040 --> 20:10.440
I'm hacked off, mate.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.440
But we...we killed it. It's killed.

20:13.440 --> 20:18.680
Yeah. But once you start the fire,
Malc, and we didn't start the fire.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.320
It's always burning since
the world's been turning, etc, etc.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.240
Sorry, Malcolm, you're
not making any sense.

20:26.240 --> 20:32.040
Prime Minister, obviously he's on
the plane in Stockholm, and somebody

20:26.240 --> 20:32.040
hits him with The World At One.

20:32.040 --> 20:36.480
He thinks it's the Treasury
trying to stiff him one, so he...

20:42.240 --> 20:44.640
He stuck with the story.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.480
He liked it?

20:46.480 --> 20:49.600
Yeah, he's backing
the Snooper Force.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.120
Oh, right.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.840
We shouldn't really then...

20:54.840 --> 20:58.760
I mean, you shouldn't
really have told us to...

20:58.760 --> 21:00.920
should you?

21:00.920 --> 21:03.000
Don't should me, Hugh,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.840
cos I'll should you right back.

21:04.840 --> 21:09.400
I'll should you right through
that window. None of this
should be happening, should it?

21:09.400 --> 21:13.760
Should it? Should it? Is that

21:09.400 --> 21:13.760
"should" in the sense of "yes" or...

21:13.760 --> 21:18.920
It's should in the sense that you
should do as you're fucking told.

21:13.760 --> 21:18.920
Yeah. What...

21:18.920 --> 21:21.560
What are we going to do now?

21:21.560 --> 21:24.840
You're going to completely
reverse your position.

21:24.840 --> 21:30.040
Hang on a second.
Malcolm, it's not actually that...

21:30.040 --> 21:33.440
That's going to be quite hard,
really.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.920
Yes, well, the announcement that
you didn't make today...you did.

21:37.920 --> 21:43.400
No, I didn't, and there were
television cameras there
while I was not doing it.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.280
Fuck them.

21:45.280 --> 21:49.560
I'm not sure...what level of reality
I'm supposed to be operating on.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.600
Look, this is what they run with.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.720
I tell them that you said it,
they believe that you said it.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.800
They don't really believe you said
it. They KNOW you never said it...

21:59.800 --> 22:05.200
Right... But it's in their interest
to say that you said it because
if they don't say that you said it,

22:05.200 --> 22:11.080
they're not going to get what you
say tomorrow, when I decide to
tell them what it is you're saying.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.400
Yeah. I am following this. I just...

22:13.400 --> 22:17.960
I had a friend who used to indulge
in extramarital affairs, OK?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.480
He'd go off
and he'd have some dalliance

22:20.480 --> 22:26.200
and every Monday, he'd come back

22:20.480 --> 22:26.200
and he'd meet his wife,
and he told me that all he did

22:26.200 --> 22:30.440
was, inside his head, turn a little
switch - the affair never happened.

22:30.440 --> 22:34.320
OK? Right. There's no...
What is the problem with this?

22:34.320 --> 22:39.480
The problem with it... First of all,
I didn't get much dalliance.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.920
Rewind today in your head.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.040
OK, stop explaining it to me!

22:44.040 --> 22:48.000
I have to fucking explain it to you!
You haven't been here long enough.

22:52.360 --> 22:56.680
Where are all the people?
Where are my people?

22:56.680 --> 23:00.840
Um, they've gone home,
Secretary of State. It's five-forty.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.920
OK, well, um, listen...

23:03.920 --> 23:08.440
The situation is, um... It's pretty
terrible but things have changed, OK?

23:08.440 --> 23:14.600
The line is now I DID announce
the Snooper Force
this afternoon at the school.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.480
OK, that's what happened, all right?

23:17.480 --> 23:24.480
So now you have to tell all the media
in case they missed it.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.640
OK?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.200
Great.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.640
I said at the beginning of today

23:28.680 --> 23:31.640
that this would happen!

23:31.640 --> 23:38.360
It's happened. It's nobody's fault,
Terri. Now we have to get a list
of everyone... It's not my fault!

23:38.360 --> 23:40.120
I didn't say it was your fault!

23:40.120 --> 23:44.520
It is somebody's fault - your fault
and your fault. It's not my fault.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.640
If you walk away,
I'll make sure it's pinned on you.
Everything going OK?

23:48.640 --> 23:52.160
You cunt! We're fucked! Great(!)

23:52.160 --> 23:55.520
This is the real world, Terri.
We're fucked.

23:55.520 --> 24:01.080
How's it going? Good.

23:55.520 --> 24:01.080
I think they might need a little bit
of co-ordination.

24:01.080 --> 24:05.960
Who spoke to Nicky Campbell? Has
anyone spoken to Nicky Campbell?

24:05.960 --> 24:08.720
I've got one missed call here,
Nicky Campbell.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.320
It's become so complicated, and
it's actually terrifically simple.

24:12.320 --> 24:16.040
There was always going to be
a Snooper Force policy. Definitely.

24:16.040 --> 24:19.920
It's too good a policy to be invented
by a disgruntled civil servant.

24:19.920 --> 24:25.560
I'm really glad you came in.
Angela, you know... Well, I could
lose my job, Olly. Yeah.

24:25.560 --> 24:30.920
I went to the news desk with three
directly contradictory stories
in one day. I know.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.160
They gave me flip-flops.

24:33.160 --> 24:39.040
You know...someone actually went out
and bought flip-flops to give me.
Yeah.

24:39.040 --> 24:45.200
You've got to give them credit for
that, though. That is quite funny.
Yeah, and they pasted onto them...

24:45.200 --> 24:49.040
a fucking porn picture of a girl
sucking a big cock,

24:49.040 --> 24:52.280
and they wrote,
"Angela Heaney swallows anything."

24:52.280 --> 24:56.040
That is less funny, obviously.
That's actually quite offensive.

24:56.040 --> 25:00.120
Can you give me one good reason why
I shouldn't do a big story on the...

25:00.120 --> 25:03.640
you know...on the day of spin?
Why? What sort of story...?

25:03.640 --> 25:09.240
You know, inside story of a
Government department out of control,
with diagrams and a flow chart

25:09.240 --> 25:14.560
with your face and name on it,
Glenn's, Hugh's, and big arrows

25:09.240 --> 25:14.560
showing who spoke to who

25:14.560 --> 25:19.320
and how you all fucked it up! I think
I could write that one myself, Olly.

25:19.320 --> 25:22.680
I could do the punctuation on it!
I'm sorry. I was patronising.

25:22.680 --> 25:27.600
Hi, Angela. Oh, I like the hair!
..How's it going? Yeah, um, fine.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.240
We were just, um, talking about

25:31.240 --> 25:38.280
why Angela shouldn't do a big story
on the big insider-y piece,

25:38.280 --> 25:43.800
kind of day-of-spin sort of spread
in the paper.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.360
I don't know.
Maybe you should. Good idea.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.160
Oh, wait a minute!

25:51.160 --> 25:55.400
I know why she shouldn't!

25:51.160 --> 25:55.400
If she did that she'd be dead...

25:55.400 --> 26:00.800
to me, to this department,
to the Government, and she'd never
get another story,

26:00.800 --> 26:06.800
or a fucking whiff of a story,
so long as she kept
her sorry hack bitch face

26:06.800 --> 26:12.200
lingering around Westminster,
because I would call every editor
I know - that's all of them -

26:12.200 --> 26:16.360
and I would tell them to gouge
her name out of their address books

26:16.360 --> 26:22.200
so she'd never even get a job on
hospital radio - where the sad sack
belongs! That's what I'd tell her.

26:22.200 --> 26:26.520
But maybe you should do it!
See you later. Yeah.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.360
He's actually...

26:28.360 --> 26:30.640
He can be really nice.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.720
It's been a very long day.

26:32.720 --> 26:39.320
I didn't say that we weren't doing
it, which is as good as saying
that we were. Bye. The World Tonight.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.600
Hello? Hugh Abbot here...

26:42.760 --> 26:45.560
It's always a pleasure
to speak to The World Tonight.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.840
Go live on air now?

26:48.960 --> 26:51.640
Yes, of course, I'd be delighted to.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.640
Robin, my pleasure.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.640
Nice to be with you.

26:59.640 --> 27:04.960
Yes. Before I answer that question,
may I say how delighted I am,
as we all are in the department,

27:04.960 --> 27:10.640
at the excitement and enthusiasm
that our Benefit Fraud
Inspection Unit has created.

27:10.640 --> 27:16.400
I announced at a press conference
this new Benefit Fraud
Inspection Unit,

27:16.400 --> 27:18.840
which we are hoping to call...

27:18.840 --> 27:21.160
Sponge Avengers,

27:21.160 --> 27:23.800
and, um, at that press conference

27:23.800 --> 27:27.440
there seems to have been a bit of
a blip

27:27.440 --> 27:31.840
because many of the journalists
didn't pick up on the announcement.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.640
They're so much looking for...

27:34.640 --> 27:39.080
ON RADIO:
'a bit of scandal or incompetence,

27:34.640 --> 27:39.080
so that statement'

27:39.080 --> 27:43.120
that the policy was the invention
of a disgruntled civil servant

27:43.120 --> 27:46.960
was actually the invention
of a disgruntled civil servant.

27:46.960 --> 27:53.160
No, there's only one disgruntled
civil servant, because one of
them's...one of them's an invention

27:53.160 --> 27:55.640
by the other one, you see?

27:55.640 --> 28:01.720
Anyone listening carefully would have
thought I sounded completely mad.

27:55.640 --> 28:01.720
No, you came over loud and clear.

28:01.720 --> 28:05.600
It's going to put the whole thing
to bed, anyway. Kill it.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.640
And Olly's offered Angela a Private
Life piece about you. Oh, great(!)

28:09.640 --> 28:13.680
A Sunday with you and the family,
go for a walk, spend time with you.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.720
She'll be checking through my books
and snooping in my bathroom cabinet

28:17.720 --> 28:23.920
and making snide remarks about how
I don't know who Gail Porter is!
We did dick her about, Hugh. Yeah.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.920
And we're getting a roasting
at the moment

28:26.920 --> 28:29.920
from what has been dubbed
flip-flop Friday,

28:29.920 --> 28:33.600
so we need all the help from friends
we can get right now. I know.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.280
Look, what do you think?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.360
Well, I just think that...

28:41.200 --> 28:45.800
I want a new driver. I don't
want to see this guy ever again.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.480
On what grounds?

28:47.480 --> 28:50.160
Smiling. Inappropriate smiling.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.560
And smirking. Smiling and smirking.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.440
I don't want to see that smile
or smirk ever again. OK?

28:56.440 --> 29:01.120
OK, thank you very much. Which way
do you want to go? Blackwall Tunnel?

29:01.120 --> 29:03.160
I don't care, you're the boss.
