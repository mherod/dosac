1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Of course I know it's our anniversary. What do you think the card was for?

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.920
I left it on the kitchen table.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.520
This programme contains strong language.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.200
Oh right. My bad, as they say.

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.640
You're a very tidy man, aren't you?

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.240
There's no happiness without order.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.320
It's a Nazi quote but it stands the test of time.

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.960
When is Peter getting in? That nurse is becoming a bit of a running sore

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.840
which is ironic. Tickle? Mr Tickle?

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.640
Mr Tickel. He's not still in his fucking tent is he?

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.120
I know we only have one anniversary a year.

12
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.640
There's a clue in the name, I did do classics.

13
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.040
I'm not being chippy, it's a fact.

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.520
I'm saying Tickel. Tickle.

15
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.480
It undermines him. If we say Tickle it makes him look stupid.

16
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.400
I was at school with a guy called Timothy Burr. Either change school

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.640
or change your name, but don't get your mum to ring my mum and complain

18
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.280
about the lumberjack jokes. Why was she complaining? Err... Timothy Burr, Tim Burr.

19
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.440
I can't leave before my coalition partner.

20
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.640
Fergus, I told you.

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.480
Well, I say partner. He's Lewis, I'm Morse.

22
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.640
I hate to ask but I've got to ask. Are you ready for today, Fergus?

23
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.000
Yeah, somewhat.

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Silicon Playgrounds are... is go.

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.600
I just hope Mannion keeps his baccy stained fingers out of it.

26
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.320
Don't worry about Mannion.

27
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.880
He's allergic to the 21st century.

28
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.720
Yeah, he didn't like the 20th much and the 19th makes him fart papyrus.

29
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.360
I think I'd better end this call now in case I get a brain tumour.

30
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.800
Precisely. I'd lose all my lovely thick hair. Can't wait for later.

31
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.880
What?

32
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960
Yes. The whole protest is really taking off. It's a sensible policy.

33
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.120
If we sell off NHS key worker housing,

34
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.040
we can pay off the PFI debts. We haven't made him live in a tent, just sold his house.

35
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.920
The cold winter will finish him off. He's like bindweed.

36
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.720
Well, you know I can be romantic.

37
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.560
Haven't we... Oh, piss. Christ, I've been spotted.

38
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.640
Peter. Can we talk Tickle?

39
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.680
I'd love to, but I think Fergus was asking for you,

40
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.240
something about Silicon?

41
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.280
OK, well. Tickle you later.

42
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.640
Oh, she just made eyes at me.

43
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.800
God, I wish I could make redundancy at her.

44
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.160
OK, so we've got 30 of these bigger phones,

45
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.920
another 50 of those, these will stay outside dotted around. Morning!

46
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.960
Big day for the reception class. Well done you.

47
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.640
Ah. Oh, I'm not sure "App-ortunity" works.

48
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.920
Yes it does.

49
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.080
It combines app and opportunity.

50
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.560
(Yes, I know that.)

51
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.760
Just looks like a team name from The Apprentice.

52
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.120
As you can see, Terri, I'm noting down every one of your comments.

53
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.200
Excuse me,

54
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.120
you asked to see me for the launch of Silicon Playgrounds, no?

55
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.000
I have never asked to see you.

56
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.680
Terri, don't worry about us. Go and help Malfoy and his dad.

57
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.040
Thanks, Ridgley.

58
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.440
I don't get it.

59
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.320
Andrew Ridgley, Wham. Hitched A Ride?

60
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.880
Oh, contemporary reference. Yeah. Yeah, very up to date.

61
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.520
Bit like your hair. What is it you ask for? The Disney Prince?

62
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
What do you ask for? Err... The...wanker?

63
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.000
Brilliant. Oh, forgot to tell you, sorry. Stewart's popping in.

64
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.040
Fuck me. What's the Last Airbender want? He needs the... Excuse me!

65
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.120
Oh, Jesus, this came through yesterday.

66
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.840
Yes, well, it came at 6:05.

67
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.080
I turn off all my work devices at six.

68
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.240
After that, it's me, the Kindle and Jodi Picoult.

69
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.600
Silicone Playgrounds project cleared for uplaunch.

70
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.240
Boom!

71
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.800
Hello, century 21.

72
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.600
We get kids to create apps in schools,

73
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.360
we pay them a digital dividend, we foster a new generation of entrepreneurs.

74
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.720
Sounds like that third Tron film no one's waiting for. We'd better tell Peter.

75
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.560
Well, we could celebrate it at another time.

76
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.400
Technically, and thrillingly, it'll be our anniversary all year!

77
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.360
Oh, sorry darling I've got to go.

78
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.480
I think the bailiffs are here take my will to live.

79
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.240
Fergus, my coalition colleague stroke junior, big day for you.

80
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.680
Every day is a big day for me,

81
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.120
that's why I get here an hour before you.

82
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.960
I'm afraid the human snowman is coming in...now.

83
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.120
Stewart! Great. Ah, if it isn't Raffles the gentleman MP.

84
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.520
Why are you coming in together? Something we should know about?

85
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.000
We were married in Vegas, didn't you know? We're really happy.

86
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.560
OK, everyone. Meeting room, now.

87
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.760
Terri, could you get someone to bring me some chai?

88
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.320
I'm parched as a cuttlefish.

89
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.080
Oh for fuck's sake.

90
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.920
OK, folks. Today's headline in Copperplate Gothic Bold, font 72,

91
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.200
is Emma and I broke the fast this AM with the PM.

92
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.120
And it is a massive yes. So our Silicon Playground initiative

93
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.400
is going to be the standard bearer for the Networked Nation.

94
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.320
It is a double double win. A double win for both babies of the coalition.

95
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.520
Absolutely. It's win squared. Terrific.

96
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520
What, shall we do a Mexican wave around the table?

97
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.560
From my POV, re all this, big hurrah, we're ready to upload,

98
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.080
ie, let's launch the fucker.

99
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.960
I'm registering your energy Fergus, but we've decided it's going to be launched by...

100
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.800
the Secretary of State for Social Affairs and Citizenship.

101
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.640
Oooh... All my gallstones have come at once.

102
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.080
Are you fucking serious? What is wrong with you people?

103
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.760
Peter can't even right click a fucking mouse.

104
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.280
He can. It's track pads he has a problem with.

105
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.240
No, you come in here, like, Dr Robotnik,

106
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.680
and say "Oh, I'm sorry."

107
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.760
We put in the graft on this. You can't just take it off us.

108
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.280
I think we can, you see... We can.

109
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.600
Coalition's like a band. Every band has a front man.

110
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.120
He's Florence and you're... The Machine. The Machine.

111
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.360
Sorry I'm late, guys. I was just changing in a phone booth.

112
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.280
Ha ha ha. Was that a joke or...? Yeah, no, I was on the phone.

113
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.920
Hey, Fergus, you look a bit A&E, everything all right?

114
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.360
No. Mannion is announcing Silicon Playgrounds on Stewart's orders.

115
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.840
PM's orders. What?

116
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.880
Hang on a moment. This is demarcation stuff.

117
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.680
This is fourth sector, right?

118
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.040
And I am the fourth sector guru.

119
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.960
I've been on Team Fergus on this, you know?

120
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.240
Me and the Inbetweeners.

121
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.800
The what? The what? Sorry?

122
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.320
You know that's what we call you.

123
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.280
We did all the work on this, us. We're a team, we did it.

124
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.080
And now you say we're playing a new game,

125
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.440
pass the parcel, and he gets to unwrap it?

126
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.560
I don't think so. This is bollocks, Stewart.

127
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.080
Come on, calm down. Just a second.

128
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.360
Just leave it, leave it.

129
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.680
He's going to have a heart attack, look at him.

130
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.240
Will we cope? Can we even carry on?

131
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.920
Oh, it doesn't seem to have changed anything.

132
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.960
The top line, folks, is this. It's about coalition, remember.

133
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.000
This is not about coalition,

134
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.920
this is about you nicking our ideas and doing us up the Eurotunnel.

135
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.040
You're a couple of homeless guys we've invited to Christmas dinner.

136
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.680
Don't bitch cos we don't let you carve the turkey. Let me say it simply for you, Stewart.

137
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.560
I don't understand the Networked Nation

138
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.200
and the Silicon fucking Playground,

139
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.680
gigabits, people watching television on telephones.

140
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.560
For what it's worth, I think Fergus should carve this particular turkey.

141
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.720
There you go.

142
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.960
Peter, the Networked Nation is about harnessing

143
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.520
the interconnectivity of everyone in society.

144
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.560
It's a new way of thinking.

145
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.400
Innovation, self-investment, revenue flux, growth,

146
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.720
ergo a healthy network.

147
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720
What's so complicated about that?

148
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.840
All the words you just used. Oh, Christ.

149
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.200
Here comes Dennis Norden. Oh, he brought his laughter file.

150
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.640
I don't know if this is any use,

151
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.240
but it might give you some idea of the scale of the problem.

152
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.320
Look, I think we're about done here, yeah?

153
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.800
OK, let's wrap this up.

154
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.120
Am I in some kind of ghost story? I've been hit by a bus

155
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.920
and no-one can see me any more?

156
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.720
Everyone's really loving your energy.

157
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.560
Why don't you pilot the staff cuts?

158
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.160
Let Peter go down to the school,

159
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.560
bounce some ideas off the wall, see if the kids like the echo.

160
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.640
So, Peter gets to announce Silicon Playgrounds,

161
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.720
I get the elephants' graveyard.

162
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.000
I could terminate some of the staff here using combat techniques.

163
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.440
Where are we actually on staff cuts? Is there a shortlist at all?

164
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.320
Phil has a staff cuts dossier with maps and charts and everything.

165
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.280
I saw a guy out there who takes three shits an hour. That's not biologically possible.

166
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.720
Well, that's Graham. He has Crohn's disease.

167
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.640
I have a very short concise brief on Silicon. I can just email it to you.

168
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.600
Put it on a piece of paper and I'll read it.

169
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.800
One piece, we don't need that.

170
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.480
Glenn, you look like a week-old party balloon.

171
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.760
Yeah, don't worry about me, Terri, I'm fine.

172
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.880
I just don't want you ending up as one of those, "Before he turned the gun on himself," kind of guys.

173
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.000
That isn't going to happen, Terri, because I don't even possess a gun.

174
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.720
Is that all that's stopping you, lack of resources?

175
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.680
Ah, Peter, I'm expecting great things.

176
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.640
Then you're an idiot. Laters, legislators.

177
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.920
The only way this policy launch could be worse is if I understood the bloody thing.

178
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.760
I'm going to put the old tea cauldron on. Anybody fancy a brew?

179
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.400
Risk of sounding like your mum. Time for school.

180
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.160
You need to get to this meeting. I hate school children.

181
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.640
They're volatile and stupid and haven't got the vote.

182
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.520
Might as well be talking to fucking geese.

183
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.120
The school's only ten minutes from your house. Pop round for a late lunch.

184
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.720
Not much of a celebration. "Hello, darling, make me a Cup-a-soup."

185
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.400
I need a thoughtful, very personal present for Tina. Any ideas?

186
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.360
Err... what about sexy undergarments?

187
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.000
No.

188
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.520
Perfume. What perfume does she wear?

189
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.920
No idea. Expensive, smells a bit of lemons.

190
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.840
I do really need a comment on this Tickel protest, please.

191
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.880
OK.

192
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.720
"As we enter the third week, I find Mr Tickle's attention seeking,

193
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.520
"tent-based twattery even more annoying than in weeks one and two."

194
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.400
I can't actually say that. Really?

195
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.800
Then by implication you know what you can say, so say that instead.

196
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.920
All right. I'll channel you.

197
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.960
Channel me?

198
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.000
She's really quite predatory, isn't she?

199
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.520
Who? Terri's Clockwork Orange? That's what I call her.

200
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.040
For the other lady in your life. Where did you get that?

201
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.640
It was in my desk. I was saving it for something special. Like losing your virginity?

202
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.920
I've done that in style, actually. If my penis could talk. It would say, "I'm lonely!

203
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.280
"Where is everyone? Let me out of this coffin!"

204
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.080
Two years ago I was a fucking guru.

205
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.360
I give two fingers to Nick and what happens?

206
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.560
Lo and behold, a party with principles comes crawling

207
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.800
and begging for me, and then what do they do with their principles?

208
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.760
Shove them on the compost heap and join the upper class-holes

209
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.080
I've spent my career trying to keep out. Glenn, I need your help.

210
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.000
I want out. I want a redundancy package.

211
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.240
Could you just bump my name up the exit list?

212
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.400
I mean, just put in a bad word for me?

213
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.720
Yeah, sure, Terri.

214
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.520
Consider yourself redundant, we all do.

215
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.400
Sorry to interrupt. Can I have a word?

216
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.680
Sure, kettle's just boiled. I meant Terri.

217
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.040
(Sorry, Glenn.)

218
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.080
Just to keep you up to speed, Terri,

219
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.560
we're going to do a companion launch for Digital Playgrounds

220
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.800
tonight at the Learning Centre at 7:00pm.

221
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.880
All right? And we just need you to pop a press pack in the

222
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.320
Coverley microwave and let us know when you've pinged.

223
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.000
Sorry, I don't think I'll be able to get that cleared before six

224
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.720
so that's effectively tomorrow, isn't it? Terri, we don't need clearance.

225
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.240
We're not covering a Beatles track, we're the fucking government.

226
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.680
I'm sorry but I do need to get that through Number 10 before I can do anything.

227
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.240
Was Terri in the meeting earlier?

228
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.240
Yeah, she was Fergus. I know she was there

229
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.840
because I heard her humming the theme to Call The Midwife.

230
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.480
Yes, well, Stewart was very clear about this protocol.

231
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.880
It's about the only thing he has been clear about.

232
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.520
The policy has been agreed.

233
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.120
This is just an additional publicity push.

234
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.720
Adam, I'm sorry if you think I'm being obstructive

235
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.880
but I cannot and I will not do as you ask.

236
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.920
Well, you can't stop me, Terri, OK? You cannot win, Nurse Ratched,

237
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.360
because this is my moment.

238
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.800
Now, you like musicals. Well, this is Tonight from West Side Story,

239
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.120
And I am going to bring the bloody house down

240
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.160
so you can't rain on my parade, funny girl!

241
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.240
Why don't you go and have a lie down and a Hob Nob

242
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.440
while we run the fucking country, all right?

243
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.960
Anything else?

244
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.040
No, don't think so.

245
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.200
Thank you, Minister.

246
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.160
Did you see me being deliberately less professional than usual?

247
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.040
You'll be gone by midday.

248
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.520
Yes! Thank God.

249
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.240
I don't understand,

250
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.960
what's the difference between upload and download?

251
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.960
Er, well you download porn although you could upload porn

252
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.440
but you'd have to, you have to make some porn first.

253
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.720
Does it have to be porn? Is it compulsory? Look, please, guys, can you stop saying porn?

254
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720
Did you say porn? Porn?

255
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.200
What's he doing? Projecting it onto the building?

256
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.680
Is he on top of everything?

257
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.800
Mentioning pornography's a definite no-no.

258
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.280
Oh, really(?) OK, so maybe I'll tell him

259
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.480
not to big up any jihad sites either or give out the PM's email address?

260
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.200
Does he understand the policy? Forgive my concern

261
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.240
but it's a bit like asking if a dog can grasp the concept of Norway.

262
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.320
'Thanks, Terri, that's very helpful, bye.' Does he understand the...?

263
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.200
Oh, she's hung up. Ever the charmless minor royal.

264
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.680
And I keep a straight face, do I,

265
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.480
when I say to a room full of frog spawn, "Upload your future?"

266
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.840
That sounds great. No pronunciation traps.

267
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.360
You know what happened to the Chancellor at the Brits.

268
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.880
Tinny Tempah. It could have been worse,

269
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.440
I heard he opened his stag do speech with "Ma niggaz."

270
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.640
Oh, I can't get my head round this whole digital dividend element.

271
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.120
Kids design apps, whatever the hell they are.

272
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.360
Don't say, "What are apps?"

273
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.320
He knows what an app is. That Ocado thing I put on your iPhone's an app.

274
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.520
And the On This Day in Jazz History thing I gifted you. You love that.

275
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.360
The best thing is you just stick with that. "I call app Britain."

276
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.840
"I call up Britain."

277
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.200
"I call app Britain." App. "I call app Britain."

278
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.600
"I call app Britain."

279
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.840
Is there some whistle Fergus blows that only you can hear?

280
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.400
It's called being wanted, Terri.

281
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.440
Right, he can go for a start.

282
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.560
He makes more noise breathing than he does fucking talking.

283
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.560
What the fuck does a Statistical Procurement Officer do anyway?

284
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.880
Fuck all. Same as the rest of them.

285
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.320
Speaking of which, Glenn.

286
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.080
Always on the horizon like a fucking Antony Gormley statue.

287
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.240
Arms outstretched covered in rust. Just let it go to voicemail.

288
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.840
No, his messages are always so long and pleading. Hi, Glenn?

289
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.080
Where have you two gone?

290
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.240
We thought we'd go through the redundancies

291
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.560
away from the dead-eyed stare of the zombie army.

292
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.640
Ah, good thinking, yeah.

293
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.200
Look, I could help prioritise that kill list, you know?

294
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.400
There are some people who want out. Terri for instance.

295
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.920
'Oh, that's no problem, Mannion fucking hates her.'

296
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.840
It's one of the few things that brings us together.

297
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.200
Is that a fruit machine I hear?

298
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.640
'Are, are you in the local?'

299
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.440
Erm, no.

300
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.520
Yes.

301
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.640
Right, OK, I'll be with you in ten. Walkies.

302
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.840
And erm, Ferg, mine's a G and a slimline T, OK?

303
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.080
See you in a mo.

304
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.240
Why is it that Silicon Valley is in America

305
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.480
when we have so many net-savvy tech heads here?

306
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.720
They may have the silicon chip,

307
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.720
but, er, we have the silicon chap.

308
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.400
And of course, chap-esses. Er, er,

309
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.200
and we want you to design game apps for use in the classroom.

310
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.680
Sorry to interrupt, erm, it's not game apps,

311
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.320
we're actually looking for educational apps.

312
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.600
Erm, of, of course.

313
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.920
That's...that's why I'm here to say, I call you up, app,

314
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.760
I...I call app Britain.

315
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.760
Yes. And...and everyone will benefit.

316
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.480
Not...not financially, er, not cash in hand, of course.

317
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.680
All profits will be stored as part of a digital dividend. Which...

318
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.080
Are you saying that if I wrote an app I wouldn't get any money for it?

319
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.520
I would be working for free?

320
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.640
If you don't mind we'll keep the Q&A to the end.

321
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.960
What...what I wanted to...

322
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.920
Sorry, why can't you just answer him now? Charlotte.

323
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.880
The other lady was allowed to interrupt.

324
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.520
Yes, but...but she's my lady.

325
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.960
LAUGHTER

326
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.840
What...what...what...what... what was your question again?

327
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.200
Why won't we profit from this?

328
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.000
Oh, but you would. Er, maybe I didn't explain it properly.

329
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.240
What, what's your name? Rajesh.

330
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.360
I'm sorry?

331
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.480
Rajesh, Raj.

332
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.560
Well, erm...

333
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.040
Rajesh Raj, erm...

334
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.680
GIGGLING

335
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.480
Right.

336
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.160
Well, erm, what I...

337
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.920
what I wanted to say is that you would erm...er...profit,

338
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.600
err, that any profits you made

339
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.480
would be, erm, offset against tuition fees...

340
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.840
Sorry, we don't believe in tuition fees.

341
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.520
Well, err, what's...? Charlotte.

342
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.200
That's an easier one.

343
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.720
Fuck me, I feel like I've just been pushed out of a plane.

344
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.720
I make apps, I sell them through Apple and I get paid for it.

345
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.720
Good for you, Ra... erm, good for you,

346
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.040
but, but, but with us,

347
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.280
you let us license it as part of the networked nation policy.

348
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.440
We all put in, you see... What do you put in to the networked nation?

349
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.120
Well, erm...

350
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.520
I am...

351
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.080
a minister.

352
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.160
But what do you actually do?

353
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.640
I, er...take the...the...

354
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.400
..science that, that you made earlier and I...

355
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.040
..apply it in...

356
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.160
..scenarios that are...

357
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.560
cost effective.

358
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.000
Well, at least I got "I call app Britain," right.

359
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.160
Thankfully with only a modicum of the contempt you used just now.

360
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.760
Hooray! You got the title right. Let's get the driver

361
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.440
to do some victory doughnuts. You're going to have to issue an apology.

362
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.280
I'm not going back there and saying, "Oh, that moment when I mistook

363
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.880
"an abbreviation of your name for your surname, sorry."

364
00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.320
I'll look completely mental.

365
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.760
You can't apologise for a fart you did a day ago.

366
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.200
You have to apologise for the follow up as well.

367
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.800
"Charlotte, that's an easier name."

368
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.320
But it is! That's a fact, not a judgement!

369
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.040
Great, Stewart. Stewart, hello. 'Can I speak to Peter, please?'

370
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.480
I wish your friend had an app

371
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.880
that would deliver Stewart a dead cat in a box. Stewart.

372
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.120
Congratulations, Peter.

373
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.360
Silicon Playgrounds has now been dubbed Mannion's Workhouse Web.

374
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.360
Well, it's not my fault if they misinterpreted something

375
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.120
that I said I never understood.

376
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.200
Oh for fuck's... I literally can't believe this man.

377
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.880
Is he trying to get sacked?

378
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.600
What he's done is close to resting his cock on his boss's wife's shoulder.

379
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.040
So, who's going to be Santa Claus, eh? What?

380
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.120
Who's getting the sack? Oh, for fu...!

381
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.840
I need to get back to DoSAC. I was looking forward to my G&T.

382
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.480
Why don't you stay here and creep out the barmaid?

383
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.720
Use your unplucked flower line.

384
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.840
Peter Mannion just got the name wrong, that's...

385
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.360
Well, names are very difficult.

386
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.720
Sometimes people spell Terri with a Y not an I but I don't complain.

387
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.120
Yes, all right I do complain but...

388
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.400
Coverley comms.

389
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.480
Heads up, OK, just keep moving. Minister, can we get a comment

390
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.200
on the secretary's speech this morning?

391
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.480
Is it true you're planning for young children to work

392
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.640
designing apps for free?

393
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.560
I understand the...the Secretary of State made...made a speech.

394
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.720
Obviously I...I haven't seen that speech.

395
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.240
He said profits would be offset against tuition fees

396
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.120
which implies pupils will be working for their education.

397
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.120
Let me be very clear the digital dividend element of this scheme

398
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.160
is optional. If they prefer pupils can be paid in cash.

399
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.040
So this isn't about turning schools into workhouses then?

400
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.400
Erm, no. Maybe Peter did come across as more of a...

401
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.320
fibre-optic Fagin than he might have intended. Thank you.

402
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.320
REPORTERS SHOUT

403
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.040
Minister, other way, other way, other way, other way.

404
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.120
Minister, why are you at home in the middle of a working day?

405
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.360
Erm, it's...it's my 30th anniversary

406
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.880
and I popped home for lunch after the Silicon Playgrounds launch

407
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.200
which is literally round the corner

408
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.360
and I'll be staying late to make up for it.

409
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.080
Are you turning schools into teenage sweatshops?

410
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.880
I...I...I'm sorry if this is proving a complex idea.

411
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.200
Pupils will receive

412
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.440
a digital dividend towards their higher education fees.

413
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.280
The dividend is optional, though. You can get cash instead?

414
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.960
No, you can't. I'm sorry. We're quoting your junior minister.

415
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.000
I see. Minister, do you think you came across this morning

416
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.920
as a fibre-optic Fagin?

417
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.160
That's a ridiculous phrase.

418
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.760
Well, that again is a quote from your junior minister.

419
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.640
Minister, is that a bottle of champagne?

420
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.760
Drinking on the job, Minister? It...It's a...a half bottle.

421
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.880
As I said, it is my anniversary and I have just recycled it.

422
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.040
Er, thank you.

423
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.960
Less of a Fagin and more of an Artful Dodger, is that what this is?

424
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.280
Run those fuckers over. 50 quid for every one you maim.

425
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.920
I've got a blank page. You dictate.

426
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.800
It should have been done like, an hour ago.

427
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.480
Thanks a fucking bunch, mate!

428
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.240
I couldn't have looked more of a twat

429
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.360
unless I'd announced it dressed as a mermaid with scallops on my tits.

430
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.200
I'm angry too, Peter. I spent a lot of time on that policy

431
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.000
that you just raped in a ditch. Your stupid idea in the first place.

432
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.400
What are your ideas, Peter? We'd love to hear them!

433
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.440
A public information film on the best wine to have with fish?

434
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.120
A butler on every street corner?

435
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.000
This is a long game, Fergus. I've been around a lot longer than you

436
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.560
and I'll still be here when they rip your name off your door

437
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.760
and turn your office back into something useful

438
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.880
like a spare toilet. Both of you desist!

439
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.760
You have caused me to raise my voice and I do not like it.

440
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.480
I reserve this level of anger for when I'm flying Ryanair.

441
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.800
Peter's palace, now!

442
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.600
Drinking champagne in the middle of the day during a recession!

443
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.400
Who do you think you are? P Diddy?

444
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.120
It was a half bottle on my 30th anniversary

445
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.040
and I was recycling it. At least give me credit for that.

446
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.360
Sorry, Peter, I take it all back. As strong a defence

447
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.600
as the fertiliser in my home-made bomb was organic!

448
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.160
What have you got planned for this evening, dancing girls?

449
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.840
Garage, car, hosepipe.

450
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.320
The anniversary present your wife's been dreaming of.

451
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.800
Fergus, what about you?

452
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.080
I'm launching Silicon Playgrounds properly at a learning centre.

453
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.600
Something you didn't clear through me! You announced this

454
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.840
before Peter took his daily gaffe dump.

455
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.680
What was the word I used this morning?

456
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.480
You used a lot of words. It was like a fucking Will Self lecture.

457
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.920
What was the word I used?

458
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.480
Coalition. Boom! So you will go to the learning centre

459
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.920
where you will re-explain Silicon Playgrounds

460
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.440
with Peter who will make an abject grovelling apology

461
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.760
for being a both a digitard and an elderly racist.

462
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.400
So first you take the policy away from me for Peter to screw up,

463
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.360
then you take salvaging the policy away from me for Peter to screw up.

464
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.000
Good yeah, that's just great(!)

465
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.240
I'm bored of this. I'm going for a Twix.

466
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.240
Adam's coming. Oh, not on my watch.

467
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.640
Oh, here we go. You shall not pass.

468
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.640
You couldn't keep the cast of Glee out.

469
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.120
Is Peter sharing a car with Fergus?

470
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.360
Wait here, I'll check. Yes go, run many miles.

471
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.440
Make heart soar like eagle.

472
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.200
Prick.

473
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.720
Peter says he's sorry but he doesn't have any child seats fitted.

474
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.280
Oh, Really? OK, kids, Raj can make it for eight o'clock.

475
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.160
What's going on? Have you two just kissed?

476
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.880
Give him this, final list of staff cuts. Needs his signature.

477
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.640
If it makes him happier, he can pretend he's sectioning you.

478
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.080
Sure, but tonight Dobby does not ride with Dumbledore.

479
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.560
Oh, fucking hell. Brilliant(!)

480
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.880
Does he have any references based in reality? Listen, don't fuck about.

481
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.840
Just make sure Fergus gets Peter to the church on time, OK?

482
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.320
All right, get a boyfriend.

483
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.880
Oh, come out.

484
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.040
She's not on the fucking list!

485
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.440
Will you please tell me why Terri Coverley is not on this list?

486
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.960
Sorry Peter, she's too expensive to get rid of.

487
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.280
Christ, Fergus we both know she's a fart in a frock

488
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.960
and I want to waft it out of here.

489
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.160
My hands are tied.

490
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.080
Fuck you! You're not getting in my car tonight!

491
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.280
What a very principled stand you're taking.

492
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280
Did you see how stressed Mannion was there?

493
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.320
Soon he'll be so weak and disorientated

494
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.640
he'll stagger off in the night like a tramp who's stood up too quickly.

495
00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.080
No, I don't think today is our entire marriage in a nutshell.

496
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.080
Well, we had champagne

497
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.680
and your sister wasn't there.

498
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.760
All I'm saying is that sometimes it's necessary

499
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.440
to lose the battle in order to win the war.

500
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.080
Or lose your mind to believe all the crap you come out with.

501
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.600
Ah here he is, the King of Sheba.

502
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.560
Er, Terri. Sorry, do you mind holding...? Jesus.

503
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.840
Just pass it to me. Why don't you get in the front?

504
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.320
We can't all get... No inconvenience at all. Budge up.

505
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.560
I...I think you'd be more comfortable in the front.

506
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.200
It's not a problem in any way.

507
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.120
Minister, ministers is it true that you hate each other?

508
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.720
Not at all. Of course, we're not strangers to a frank exchange of views.

509
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.440
Have you been forced to come here together?

510
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.120
I think I can say in all candour that no one could force me

511
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.920
to stand next to this man.

512
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.280
Ah, Raj. Thank you so much for coming.

513
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.760
Raj.

514
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.000
Good to see you, Peter Pete.

515
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.000
Err, I'd like to thank er, er, Raj here

516
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.160
for pointing out the flaws in Fergus's

517
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.640
and, and my Silicon Playground scheme.

518
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.040
Yeah, and we'd love you to become a silicon player, Raj.

519
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.600
Help us nail it, yeah? Yeah, sure, if you pay me.

520
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.240
Can you get me a chicken and cashew nut?

521
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.600
Get your usual order, dead dog's dicks.

522
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.160
They're still down at the centre.

523
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.320
No, my children, not them I'm looking for but you.

524
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.680
I thought while they were dovetailing we might chat the chit.

525
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.960
There's no reason why we can't go bigger on this.

526
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.000
With the spread of computer literacy across all demographics.

527
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.640
We could be having silicon pubs, silicon prisons,

528
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.160
silicon care homes.

529
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.480
I mean this way we really would have a networked nation guys.

530
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.800
Silicon banks. Silicon hospitals. Silicon buses.

531
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.640
Err, silicon phones, silicon lights, silicon plants...

532
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.200
No, Phil, don't just say what you fucking see.

533
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.560
Why don't we hive mind on this? Get our best brains on it.

534
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.440
Adam come and join us. Phil, go make us some ginseng tea.

535
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.200
You're getting a coffwee, coffee with wee in it.

536
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.280
So the core question here is can we engender the same sense

537
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.600
of pan-demographic communalities we had in the war,

538
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.280
but furrowed into the digital revolution, hmm?

539
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.960
Do you have milk in ginseng?

540
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.880
No. Shit.

541
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.120
Simeon, hi. Yeah he is, he's with me.

542
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.360
Number 10. Apparently your phone's off.

543
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.560
That's because my mind is in give mode not receive mode. Simeon, hi.

544
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.120
No, no, no, no, no, don't say that.

545
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.160
No, no don't drown the kitten here!

546
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.920
Look, we're cooking up the Schlieffen plan for the mind here!

547
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.600
No, I'm sorry I don't believe he said that. No.

548
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.680
OK.

549
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.440
OK, curious.

550
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.880
What's happened?

551
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.520
Silicon Playgrounds, erm... dead.

552
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.280
Too much confusion and negativity.

553
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.560
Says who? The PM. Oh, for God's sake.

554
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.520
Interesting, he's never used a conduit to deliver bad news before.

555
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.160
Sorry should I not have left the bags in? No, they look lovely.

556
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.760
Are you all right, Stewart, can I...?

557
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.840
No, I'm erm, I am... I'm going to go and rest my eyes on the river.

558
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.800
He touched me. OK.

559
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.520
Well, landmark day.

560
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.960
We bring in an idea, you like it, you nick it,

561
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.240
you put two bullets in the back of its head.

562
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.840
Snuff politics, you've got to laugh.

563
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.680
It's good to see Stewart lost for multi syllables though.

564
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.080
Have you ever seen him like that before? Never.

565
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.080
He took the morning off when Steve Jobs died.

566
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.360
But otherwise, been seven years of ear piss.

567
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.920
Ah, look at us, Fergus We're such good friends.

568
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.320
It's like Ike and Tina Turner. Or Caligula and his horse.

569
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.480
This will cheer you up.

570
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.200
Your boss has chucked Silicon Playgrounds down a well

571
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.000
and poured a bucket of shit after it.

572
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.720
Whole day, it's been an excruciating waste of time.

573
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.160
Am I...am I needed?

574
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.600
We'll get back to you on that.

575
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.960
We can stop pretending to like each other now.

576
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.160
Maybe it would be better if we actually did try to get on

577
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.400
rather than just pretending.

578
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.000
Maybe it would.

579
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.760
Have a good, erm...

580
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.120
what's left of the evening.

581
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.840
Thanks.

582
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.440
OK, darling I'm on my way.

583
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.640
Finally got rid of Captain fucking Scarlet.

584
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.440
DoSAC please Martin.

585
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.840
Terri, hi, it's Glenn.

586
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.880
Silicon Playgrounds has been axed and so's your evening!

587
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.360
They want you to come in and draft a press release. And by draft I mean

588
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.800
work on it all night.

589
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.520
Oh, no.

590
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.880
Looks like he's going back to DoSAC.

591
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.360
I'm sorry Tina I'm going to have to turn round.

592
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.160
Are you about to head off?

593
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.880
I'm sorry it should be...

594
00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.800
11 at the latest.

595
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.480
Could, could, could you just put

596
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.920
something eggy on a tray for me?

597
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.920
And...and then we will

598
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.360
snuggle, I promise.

599
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.880
The Leader of the Opposition is in that room, Malcolm,

600
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.880
practicing walking. It does seem to be taking an awfully long time.

601
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.640
Is that too bouncy? It's Remembrance Sunday!

602
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.160
We haven't got any fucking power.

603
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.920
We're like a family in a Cuban slum.

604
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:36.280
It's important that we rise above partisan politics, Dan.

605
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.560
So that, Dan...

606
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.280
I feel like I should put the poppy wreath around my neck

607
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.560
and take 40 paracetamol.

608
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.600
