WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.640
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour

00:05.640 --> 00:07.640
We persuade him with the
carrot and stick approach.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.000
Stick a carrot
up his fucking arse,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.760
followed by the stick, followed
by an even bigger carrot.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.520
Hello.

00:13.520 --> 00:18.280
Ah, you got past mad
conference security then.
It's bonkers, isn't it?

00:18.280 --> 00:22.960
It's like trying to get through
Israeli customs wearing a T-shirt

00:18.280 --> 00:22.960
saying "I heart bombing Israel".

00:22.960 --> 00:27.120
I had to wait for an hour and
they practically gave me a cavity
search. Only practically?

00:27.120 --> 00:29.400
The disappointment
in your voice is palpable.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.640
Oh, your bed's bigger than mine.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.320
Your whole room's
bigger than mine.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.560
Well, um, do you want it.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.000
Mr Lover Lover, full marks for
foreplay there, Glen. Straight in.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.480
Do I want your room? No. I just
thought they'd all be the same,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.480
vanilla and monotonous.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.720
Did you ask for your
special tiny kettle?

00:44.480 --> 00:48.720
It's an electric thimble.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.520
Maybe the room only looks bigger
because Glen's kettle is so tiny.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.240
Has our people's champion arrived?
Have you spoken to her?

00:55.240 --> 00:58.360
Is she all right? Oh, no, no, no.
She should be over it by now.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.760
Her husband died four months ago,
so she's beyond the crying thing.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.520
She's clearly not that over it,

01:03.520 --> 01:06.960
she's leading a campaign
to change building regulations.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.560
Seven people died when
that cafe collapsed,
she's entitled to her 15 minutes.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.520
How do you think I should, um...

01:14.520 --> 01:16.600
mention the tragedy
when I talk to her?

01:16.600 --> 01:20.360
Just, sorry for your loss,
thoughts with you at
this very difficult time,

01:20.360 --> 01:24.880
yada-yada-yada, without
the yada-yada-yada bit, obviously.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.640
I'll need some
jokes for my speech.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.720
Is that a good idea?
Not collapsing cafe jokes? No.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.440
Shame,
I had a bunch of those.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.800
Thought you could call them
the Little Chef Seven, you know,

01:35.800 --> 01:37.479
special of the day, crumble.

01:37.479 --> 01:39.920
That's not funny.
Good evening, minister.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.960
I'm your press officer
at conference.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.960
Nicola Murray. Hi.
How was your holiday?

01:43.960 --> 01:48.440
Well, you know, we wanted to
go to Florida, but Malcolm
suggested we went to Suffolk

01:48.440 --> 01:51.000
so the kids were miserable,
weather was miserable

01:51.000 --> 01:53.880
and Malcolm rang and shouted
at me for looking miserable.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.320
I saw the photos in the wellies
next to the horse,
"why the long face?" It was funny.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.280
Or not. Depending on your
perspective. Things are looking up.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.080
You're in Eastbourne now
which is the jewel
of our shit seaside resorts.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.960
Clacton of the south west
they call it.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.800
Anyway, I'm here
to meet Julie Prince.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.480
Price. That's the fellow.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.640
She's the, ah...
Applause monkey.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.800
That's funny, the applause monkey.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.760
Show some respect for fuck's sake,
her husband's just died.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.800
I'm so sorry.
You're quite right.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.840
I will now observe
a moment's silence.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.800
John, do you know what the wifi
password is? I don't know.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.360
No? No. But you've been here
a couple of days.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.079
I haven't really had time.

02:31.079 --> 02:34.600
Despite this calm exterior
I am not waving but drowning.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.720
John, are you across this
thing about Peter Manyon... Yeah.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.120
..lining up a second holiday?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.120
Manyon, right, yeah.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.360
Peter Manyon, my opposite number.
Yes.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.280
You're going to push that
for the press for me, yeah?

02:46.280 --> 02:49.680
I just want to remind people
that while he's criticising us

02:49.680 --> 02:51.880
he's swanning around on
his friend's yacht.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.560
Oh, OK. He's gay.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.120
Oh, for fuck's sake. Jesus.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.120
No, it's a hypocrisy thing.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.960
In principal, yeah, but it
is conference so my "to do" list
is longer than a big willie.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.680
Without wishing
to sound blunt,

03:04.680 --> 03:09.320
actually, you know what, fuck it,
let's sound blunt, it is your job.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.040
I'll do what I can.
That is a Duggan promise.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.640
He's not going to do it.
Fucking useless.
He's not going to do it.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.079
He's got that fringe to hide
the lobotomy scars. Is that right?

03:20.079 --> 03:22.200
I'm absolutely certain of it.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.840
So what's the beard for?
Who is she by the way?

03:24.840 --> 03:27.440
Oh, hello again. Ollie right? Yes.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.360
She was married to one of those guys
who died when that cafe collapsed.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.520
She's not going to cry on me,
is she? Get enough of that at home.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.920
Glen says she's
changed her Facebook status

03:36.920 --> 03:41.880
to single and up for it which
I believe is why Glen
brought her here in the first place.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.760
Listen, John, it's an outside
chance that she may

03:44.760 --> 03:48.720
just prefer to meet a human being
so I'm going to come down with you.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.600
Good idea. You can buy her a coffee.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.800
Maybe you could buy
her a "collapsaccino".

03:52.800 --> 03:56.800
Might bring back memories of her
latte husband. As in late husband.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.960
Yeah. We're like Dick and Dom.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.880
Accept neither one of you are Doms.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.040
Terri, hi it's me. Have you read
up about this Peter Manyon

04:04.040 --> 04:06.400
second holiday thing on
the Dig Deep blog?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.720
No, I haven't seen that.
Where's he off to?

04:08.720 --> 04:13.040
Amalfi. So could you make a few
phone calls, see if you can
get it some press traction?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.600
I can't do that.
That's party political matter.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.240
You'll have to get
John Duggan onto that,
it's his responsibility.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.760
The trouble is, that the only thing
Duggan is doing here is depriving

04:22.760 --> 04:24.480
a village somewhere of a twat.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.920
'I've heard he's about
as useless as a chocolate teapot.'

04:27.920 --> 04:30.960
We shouldn't say that,
it sounds a bit racist.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.960
Where are you?

04:30.960 --> 04:33.280
Just on the way down to Hastings

04:30.960 --> 04:33.280
to see my sister.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.440
She's having trouble
shifting a piano,
so I'm working from home today.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.320
You're not working and
you're not at home so,

04:40.320 --> 04:43.400
as my 16-year-old would say,
you are totally busted.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.680
We're thrilled
to have you on board.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.600
Although, of course, terribly sad
about your news at the same time.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.440
Yeah right, um... Yeah. You are?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.560
John Duggan, press officer.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.680
It is an honour. Maybe that's
pushing it a bit far but I mean

04:56.680 --> 05:00.200
it's very nice to meet
a civi... a normal, as it were.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.160
So have you seen the charms of
Eastbourne, whatever they may be?

05:04.160 --> 05:07.840
Not really.
I've been working on me speech.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.560
You've got a speech?
Right, well, no problem.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.560
We'll have to get it cleared.
Do you have a copy of it on you?

05:13.560 --> 05:16.720
Sorry about your loss
of your husband.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.480
In the collapse of that,
of that cafe.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.880
What have we got on the workplace
gym reward scheme?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.880
Fighting obesity is one of
the biggest challenges we face,

05:26.880 --> 05:30.560
sleepwalking into a crisis,
ticking time bomb...

05:30.560 --> 05:34.840
You write almost entirely in generic
meaningless buzzwords, don't you?

05:34.840 --> 05:37.200
I could take it more street
if you would prefer.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.120
INDISTINCT

05:40.120 --> 05:41.480
..but you know this is...

05:41.480 --> 05:45.200
I don't want to come across all
nanny state and "death by chocolate

05:45.200 --> 05:48.760
"is not a funny name for a pudding
it's a real and genuine concern".

05:48.760 --> 05:51.640
I don't want to give the press
another opportunity to see me as

05:51.640 --> 05:55.560
Mrs Sour Power Vinegar Tits Sucking
On A Lemon. Fine. I understand.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.440
So, we'll sugar-coat it.
Well, leaven it ideally
with a couple of jokes.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.200
Yeah, all right, no problemo.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.320
Now? Jokes now?

06:03.320 --> 06:06.680
Yes. OK. How about,

06:06.680 --> 06:10.080
we want people to be fit,
not fit to burst?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.240
I'll have to go down
the slapstick route.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.480
Do the speech straight, but dressed
as Freddy Star's Hitler.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.160
These are the worst pictures
I've seen, they really are.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.000
I don't know who's taken them,
Roy fucking Orbison!

06:21.000 --> 06:24.320
Oh, Malcolm? Yeah?
Have you seen Rob Holt's blog today?

06:24.320 --> 06:26.680
Of course,
yeah, I read Rob Holt's blog.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.360
I read all the blogs because
I'm an under-employed fat

06:29.360 --> 06:32.840
fucking loser with nothing better
to do with my time than sit

06:32.840 --> 06:36.800
in my bedroom like a fat space
hopper in a tracksuit

06:36.800 --> 06:40.240
reading inconsequential
unspell-checked shit

06:40.240 --> 06:44.600
fabricated by other
fat fucking losers.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.360
Well, he's saying that the big
health numbers in the PM's speech,

06:48.360 --> 06:50.080
they're from a false sample.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.320
Apparently, they're lifted
from Andrew Dover's
blog not from the ONS.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.760
I wouldn't take any notice.
There's nothing in that.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.520
Nothing in it? Nothing at all.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.200
I'll catch yous later, OK?

07:01.200 --> 07:03.960
Sam, the health stats
fuck up is out there

07:03.960 --> 07:07.400
and I don't know who's
doing it, but I want his
balls on a fucking plate.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.440
Well, I don't know. Google goolies.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.880
Nicola, this is Julie.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.880
Thank you for joining us. What you
are doing is really important.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.440
Well, hi. I'm your regional
photo opportunity for the day.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.360
That's not, that's not the way
it is. I hope you appreciate that.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.080
I was just kidding.
That's a good joke. That's what
we need in this room!

07:26.080 --> 07:28.560
Julie's written a speech.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.240
For today? Yeah.
What's that about then?

07:33.240 --> 07:37.200
Well, basically, I start by doing
a tribute to me husband, Jason.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.640
Uh-huh. And then we'll
move on to the campaign.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.880
We get to the middle section
and I just want

07:41.880 --> 07:45.240
to tell everyone how we're trying
to take that bastard to court.

07:45.240 --> 07:49.680
You'll get that opportunity
to tell... Me and six women

07:45.240 --> 07:49.680
whose husbands have died,

07:49.680 --> 07:53.680
we're trying our best to do him,
but you know what that bastard did?

07:49.680 --> 07:53.680
Tell me.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.880
He sent everyone off the site
and changed the equipment.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.440
He changed it to the
actual proper legal equipment
so we've got no proof.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.360
What a bastard.
What a bastard.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.800
And, oh, God,
I'm sweating like a fat lass.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.160
Maybe this isn't a great room
for you to be in.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.840
We've got to write some stupid jokes
about a rich bloke on a yacht.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.800
I've got more to tell ya, there's...

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
Yeah, I want to hear it.
I want to hear it.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.240
Yeah, let's, we'll knock off
this stuff and then I'm with you.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.560
Nice to meet you. Ollie's a lovely
guy, he'll look after you.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.720
Yeah, look, I'm sorry, chief,
but there's no way that I can spin
these health stats, they're fucked.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.960
We'll have to put something else
in the speech.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.720
I don't know. What about the missus,
can we wheel her out again?

08:35.720 --> 08:39.880
She has that thing about appearing
to be a normal human being,
that plays well.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.880
Oh, hey, Malc, how's it hanging?
Like the Gardens of Babylon.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.760
Do you know where
Lord Clarkham's room is?

08:44.760 --> 08:48.080
No... I'm gonna try and stick his
balls in his fucking trouser press.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.200
Oh, right. I see you've pulled.
Um, look, this is Julie Price.

08:52.200 --> 08:57.800
She is the People's Champion that
Nicola is announcing in her speech.
Julie Price.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.480
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.760
Are you being looked after
well enough? Yeah, not bad.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.000
You stick with Ollie,
he's a good guy.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.880
I know he looks a bit like
an anorexic Leo Sayer there...

09:09.880 --> 09:12.400
Listen, can I have a photo
taken with you? Who me?

09:12.400 --> 09:15.440
Yeah. I've got a little collection
of memories, you know...

09:15.440 --> 09:17.520
OK. Mandela and stuff.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.760
Ollie, would you be so kind
as to do the honour, good sir?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.440
Do you mind if I...? All right?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.440
Just... Oh, fucking higher.
All right.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.760
Ee, you're a stunner!
No, you're a stunner.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.920
You really are. Very impressive.
And I'm not the only one
who's impressed but the PM,

09:31.920 --> 09:35.040
he finds you very impressive.
That's good. Great.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.920
I think there is a point
in his speech today... Mmm.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.600
..where he would be very honoured
to introduce you.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.480
Um... Is that something that
would interest you? Yeah.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.800
Yes, it might clash with Nicola's
championing of Julie's cause.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.680
Oh, God. Look the nerves are getting
to us, I need to use your bog.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.680
Yeah, that's the ladies, there.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.960
Malcolm, you can't...
you can't do that.

09:54.960 --> 09:59.680
She's our bonus track, she's our
DVD Easter egg, we need her for

09:54.960 --> 09:59.680
the speech. Boo fucking hoo.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.640
Can't do it now, Ollie. Yes,

09:59.680 --> 10:04.640
but that's, what, in two hours? Two
hours think of a whole new speech?

10:04.640 --> 10:06.640
Oh, welcome to the men's room.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.720
Jesus Christ. Listen, it's this
simple, right. If she goes on

10:09.720 --> 10:13.120
with Nicola, she'll be watched
by 15 housebound mouth-breathers.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.520
Oh, and by the ever-swelling
ranks of the unemployed
who fucking hate us, by the way.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.760
But if she goes on with Tom, she'll
make the ten o'clock news, right?

10:21.760 --> 10:24.480
Julie, hi. Feel better?
Yeah, good. We should...

10:24.480 --> 10:26.520
Now, what's it going to be, darling?

10:26.520 --> 10:30.760
Do you want to go with the teasmaid
or with the caravan?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.840
I'm going with the caravan.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.560
That is the prime minister?
That is the prime minister.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.480
Sorry, Ollie. It's nice to meet you.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.360
Are you actually in the hotel or
are you...? Oh, I'm staying at...

10:42.360 --> 10:45.440
So, joking aside - of course we

10:42.360 --> 10:45.440
haven't fucking got those yet...

10:45.440 --> 10:50.040
I know. But whatever they are,
it's now my great pleasure...

10:45.440 --> 10:50.040
Right... We're just doing...

10:50.040 --> 10:51.880
No, no, no, listen. What? Listen.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.360
What? You know
when something bad happens and

10:54.360 --> 10:56.600
you think it's not
as bad as you think...

10:56.600 --> 11:01.240
Where's Julie?
Malcolm's commandeered Julie
for the PM's speech.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.800
We bumped into each other...

11:02.800 --> 11:06.560
What do you mean?
You're supposed to be looking
after her, for fuck's sake.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.600
No, no, he hasn't. He can't...
We can't even fucking trust you

11:06.560 --> 11:10.600
to babysit.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.560
Malcolm took her... Just say no.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.400
Just say no?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.640
Don't you understand?

11:15.640 --> 11:19.880
Babysitting...? Malcolm!
Fuck Malcolm.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.720
Fuck Malcolm! Fuck Malcolm!

11:21.720 --> 11:26.040
Fuck Malcolm! Well, um, that was
my initial reaction as well.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.240
Deep breath, Nicola.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.480
Yes, I know. Thank you, thank you.
Fuck off! Thank you.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.800
Right, yes, what do you
want us to do?

11:35.800 --> 11:38.520
Do you want your rescue remedy?
No. Fuck off.

11:38.520 --> 11:42.920
Get me some ketamine, I want to
separate my mind from my body. Fuck.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.120
Jesus Christ! Poor Nicola.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.160
OK, right. I'm going to have to
talk to the bastard. Take some...

11:49.160 --> 11:53.560
Yeah, that's right rip your shirt
off. Go on Braveheart, freedom.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.280
What, have you got a text there?

11:55.280 --> 11:57.240
Yeah. Be with you in a minute.

11:57.240 --> 12:00.400
Listen, just casually mention
to Lindsay Anorexi at the Mail

12:00.400 --> 12:03.400
that the PM has brought
Julie Price to the conference.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.440
That's not strictly true though,
is it?

12:05.440 --> 12:08.360
Well, Strictly Come Dancing
isn't strictly dancing, is it?

12:08.360 --> 12:11.520
There's also a bit at the beginning
where an old man dribbles.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.480
So what? I didn't really
follow that. My point is...

12:14.480 --> 12:18.120
Oh, Glen. Right, OK, mate. Look,
I can see you're a tad peeved...

12:18.120 --> 12:20.600
I'm not having it.
You've gone too far.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.160
Hey, get a grip, Glen.
I didn't fucking come in your mouth.

12:24.160 --> 12:29.720
Are you in on this? Oh, God no. No,
I'm just obeying orders, like a
Nazi guard. Only in a non-gassy way.

12:29.720 --> 12:34.200
You're not Jewish are you? No.
Oh, good. Can you just take...?
Yeah. Why don't you go in here.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.400
Some important people and biscuits
in there. Have a coffee.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.520
Don't want to bring back bad
memories. What are you on about?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.960
Your husband died in a cafe.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.920
You can't just take her.
That's people trafficking.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.880
Am I being threatened
by Harold fucking Bishop?

12:48.880 --> 12:53.960
OK, look guys, can we just...?
Oh, shit, wow - here's the beige

12:48.880 --> 12:53.960
fucking power ranger now.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.560
Yeah, and we're taking her back.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.800
Do not make this
a disciplinary issue.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.880
Do you here me?
I fucking found her.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.920
She was on the fucking news!
Get him out.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.160
Can we get a bit
more sane about this, please?

13:05.160 --> 13:08.880
This is not a fucking discussion.
All right, nobody argue, OK?

13:08.880 --> 13:11.240
Arguments don't...
I am going to take...

13:11.240 --> 13:13.360
Oh, fuck off. Fuck...

13:13.360 --> 13:15.120
Jesus Christ.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.320
All right, you've hurt yourself.
Oh, I've got so much on, as it is.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.360
You hit me. I did not hit you.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.880
I went to hit the fucking wall and
pulled my fist back and hit you in

13:21.360 --> 13:25.880
the fucking face instead.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.480
I think you've broken my nose. Oh,
no, no, that's just a scratch, mate.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.280
Noses can't break. That's a myth.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.960
What the fuck are you talking about?

13:32.960 --> 13:35.080
Lean forward, you want the blood

13:32.960 --> 13:35.080
to flow out

13:35.080 --> 13:37.640
your nose, not down your throat
like a gurgling drain.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.200
Don't touch me. Look at him.
Have you got a hanky?

13:43.760 --> 13:46.200
John, let's get him back
to his room. OK, yeah.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.960
Nobody saw that?
No, it's like when a fight starts.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.040
You're just like, fight, fight,
fight! You all right? OK?

13:52.040 --> 13:55.120
He's fine. He's all right.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.360
He's got a nose bleed.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.360
If you breathe a
word of this, right?

13:59.360 --> 14:02.920
Mmm hmm. Listen to me Richard
Stilder you fucking jazzy bastard...

14:02.920 --> 14:07.840
I am listening. Help me here.
Let's get noses supposes back

14:02.920 --> 14:07.840
to his fucking... Where is he?

14:07.840 --> 14:10.280
I don't know. Jesus Christ. Come on.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.240
Yeah, it's all right, don't worry.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.480
Oh, my God, Glen, what happened?

14:15.480 --> 14:18.680
Well, I don't think Malcolm
saw my point of view.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.920
Fair point. I got punched.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.640
That is a lot of blood.
Is that normal?

14:23.640 --> 14:28.000
We need a cold press, or is there
ice? Oh... What about the mini-bar?

14:28.000 --> 14:32.960
Oh, God... Is there a...?
Yeah, look at that.
Oh, my God, everything's tiny.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.600
Are you having a turn, Glen?
No, I mean the can is tiny.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.600
Oh, OK. Sorry. The kettle is tiny.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.840
Come and sit down.
Oh, that's better.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.960
You look like a squeezed doughnut.
We need a flannel.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.960
And some hot water
so I'm going to boil a kettle...
Look, I'm not having a baby.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.080
No. No, and anyway it's
a bloody nano-kettle.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.600
There is a hot tap, Nicola.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.720
Jesus, what am I like? I mean, I
could make you a cup of tiny tea.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.840
Right. Um, so there's the...

14:56.840 --> 14:59.800
You want me to...?
OK, I'll have a go.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.160
Um...put your head back.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.840
I think Malcolm said, "Forward."
Is it forward?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.360
I've always had childcare.

15:05.360 --> 15:10.280
So, um can you try and keep
the bloody handkerchief away from
my dress... Yes. If you don't mind.

15:10.280 --> 15:14.720
Oh, dear. It looks very sore.
I'm assuming we've lost
our People's Champion, yeah?

15:14.720 --> 15:16.240
It felt like a "No" to me.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.400
Did it feel like a "No" to you,
Glen? Oh, I think a "No".

15:19.400 --> 15:21.840
I'm so fucked.
I've got an hour and a half.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.360
With all due respect, Nicola,
there's a human aspect to all this.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.040
I know, and you were very brave.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.400
Just, realistically,
there is so little I can

15:29.400 --> 15:31.960
do about it and I've got
to write the fucking speech.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.160
So, Ollie,
could you get on with that?

15:34.160 --> 15:36.760
Glen, why don't you come
to my room and lie down.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.520
Put a towel down on the bed,
just... Jesus, Malcolm.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.280
What? Oh, God. How is the patient?

15:41.280 --> 15:44.800
I don't want to speak to you
right now, Malcolm.
I think you should leave.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.360
Do you?

15:46.360 --> 15:50.880
Yes. What, are you going to hit me?
I don't fucking hit women.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.440
Except Glen, obviously. Just you
fucking leave Glen out of this.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.280
Glen's been through enough as it is.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.560
Listen, mate, I'm really...
I'm really sorry, right, I'm really

16:00.560 --> 16:03.480
sorry about what happened in
the heat of the fucking moment.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.120
I'm under pressure,
trying to plug a lot of leaks.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.000
I had my finger in the dyke
but the dyke's very, very squirty.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.880
Is it Fat Pat?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.960
I've heard that she's a... Shut up.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.120
We're old soldiers, right,
this is life in war time, OK?

16:16.120 --> 16:20.240
I mean, every now and then
you're going to get an incident
of friendly fire.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.360
Yeah? Yeah.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.440
Good man. Yes. Good.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.040
Now, you've lost Geordie Julie,
the merry fucking widow,

16:33.040 --> 16:36.240
you've got a hole in your speech.
Have we got a contingency?

16:36.240 --> 16:38.480
We'll figure it out.
Why don't I help you?

16:38.480 --> 16:41.960
Let's roll some tits up the flagpole
and see if anyone gets wood.

16:41.960 --> 16:46.160
Oh, Christ, it's like being trapped
in a fucking boys toilet.

16:46.160 --> 16:51.360
Right, all we've got is Manyon's

16:46.160 --> 16:51.360
second holiday. We need
to take the piss out of that.

16:51.360 --> 16:57.080
OK, how about he's called
Peter two-holidays Manyon? Glen?

16:57.080 --> 17:02.160
Um, he's, um, worked really hard

16:57.080 --> 17:02.160
at planning his holidays.

17:02.160 --> 17:07.880
That's really fucking quality
fucking explosive sarcasm you're

17:02.160 --> 17:07.880
lobbing out there, mate. Boom.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.839
I feel I'm in a therapy group
being run by my own rapist.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.560
Right, OK, well how about...?
Oh, my God.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.800
It's got out. No really? I thought

17:14.560 --> 17:18.800
it was room service cold calling.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.440
Who the fuck
is leaking this out there?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.920
Find out who
is pissing this over the wall.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.440
Well, the thing about the internet,
Malcolm, is it's quite big.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.680
It's on Rob Holt's blog.
I don't know what he looks like...

17:30.680 --> 17:33.640
You need to get your People's
Champion out of this hotel

17:33.640 --> 17:36.760
before some tabloid mince flannel
starts soft-soaping her.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.840
We've got her back now,
is that right?

17:38.840 --> 17:42.520
Don't be so fucking touchy
about it. There's a lot
to fucking deal with.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.000
She's my responsibility now.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.040
It doesn't matter about
the speech, that's fine.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.040
It doesn't fucking matter.

17:48.040 --> 17:53.880
Women, huh? Women slam the door.
Where did this idea come from, huh?

17:48.040 --> 17:53.880
Wilma!

17:53.880 --> 17:56.040
Fuck off. I'm making a phone call.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.760
Make a phone call.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.480
Phone a fucking friend.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.440
Hello. Terri, it's Nicola again.

18:02.440 --> 18:06.000
We're at Defcom One or Five
or whichever the really bad one is.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.360
You stupid pillock. Oh, boy racers.

18:09.360 --> 18:13.000
Terri, can you harness that anger
and bring it down to Eastbourne?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.480
I desperately need you
to come down and help me.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.200
The problem is this party political
problem because I'm a civil servant

18:19.200 --> 18:23.840
and I cannot possibly
be seen to have anything
to do with a party conference.

18:23.840 --> 18:29.600
Terri, please. I am standing in

18:23.840 --> 18:29.600
a factory that makes fans right,
and a man has walked in with a giant

18:29.600 --> 18:36.360
shit spraying machine and you happen
to be bunking off work and not
very far away, so I need you here.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.920
Listen, I've got a cagoule
in the back and I could

18:38.920 --> 18:42.160
come incognito with the hood up

18:38.920 --> 18:42.160
if that's going to help you out.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.080
This is what my life's come to.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.960
Exchanging hostages round
the back of the hotel. Yeah,
very nice to meet you, Julie...

18:48.960 --> 18:51.840
And you. Thank you for coming
with me. That's all right.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.360
The cruddiest spy film ever.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.800
The Eastbourne Ultimatum.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.760
We just thought we might just
get you out of the hot seat.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.480
I'm allergic to dogs, I can't...

19:00.480 --> 19:02.520
Come on!
But she's got a dog with her.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.320
Yeah, that's Max.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.320
She's got a fucking dog with her.

19:05.320 --> 19:09.160
He's diabetic, four shots a day,
can't leave him anywhere. Get in!

19:09.160 --> 19:11.480
As long as we're not
in the car for very long.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.440
Now the dogs in. Is she going
to put Julie in the boot?
I'm gonna ring him.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.440
Excuse me, your phone's ringing.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.520
Yes?

19:17.440 --> 19:21.520
Get a fucking move on. Where are you?

19:21.520 --> 19:23.480
Never mind where I am.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.840
I can see you and you're not in
the car and you're not driving away.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.720
Go away.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.720
And you should be, so fuck off.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.320
Glen, come on, you have a bit more.
All right, Malc.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.800
Watch your step, I don't want
you tripping up again! Absolutely.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.560
D-Day. What is it Malcolm?
I thought you were
one of the boxers, not the MC.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.680
No, no. It's just
I've got to show my face

19:41.680 --> 19:45.240
at a few receptions this evening
including the Rod Hughes do for Tom.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.680
Believe me I'd rather slip into
something a bit more comfortable,

19:45.240 --> 19:49.680
like a fucking coma.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.200
Malcolm, you've started
beating up your own guys.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.200
That has to be a bad sign.
I didn't hit fucking Glen.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.720
Why would I do that? And you've
got absolutely no proof that I did.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.360
Yeah, whatever you say, Malcolm.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.720
Look at this,
he doesn't flinch, does he?

20:04.240 --> 20:07.840
We have a laugh that's all.
No, we're mates. We're pals, look.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.880
Look at the size of him.
I wouldn't fucking hit him,
he's a fucking man mountain.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.600
Hey, you saying I'm fat?
That's the banter.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.600
Government department...
to govern... Fuck, how can I learn
this when you're still writing?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.320
I feel sick. No, it's exciting!

20:21.320 --> 20:24.360
The fact that you're hearing it
for the first time when you say it

20:24.360 --> 20:27.400
will possibly give it a freshness
and a zing, you know...

20:27.400 --> 20:30.200
You know this is politics as it is!
It's the West Wing.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.280
You're not Josh. Write the speech.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.480
Pull yourself together, Nicola.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.680
Fucking am Josh.
Nicola Murray can do this, come on.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.320
Wow, did you just refer to
yourself in the second
and third persons, they're...

20:40.320 --> 20:45.440
Write the fucking speech. OK, yes,
I'm just slightly distracted by

20:40.320 --> 20:45.440
all the Nicola Murrays in the room.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.440
Hello Malcolm. Shite to see you,

20:45.440 --> 20:49.440
to see you shite. Come with me.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.000
Is this going to take long, Malcolm?
I'm really up against it.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.920
Er, you're looking very
dapper by the way, very nice.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.680
Like there'd been a Scottish
James Bond. Shut the fuck up.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.920
Why are we coming in here?

21:00.920 --> 21:02.480
I know you leaked the punch story.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.200
Fistigate?

21:04.200 --> 21:06.320
Don't call it that.
Where did you hear that?

21:06.320 --> 21:11.040
Somebody said it was called
Fistigate, I said I didn't
realise it was called that.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.600
Fuck. Fuck me. I... I didn't
leak anything, I swear to God.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.680
You're not going to tweezer me,
are you?

21:16.680 --> 21:18.680
No, no, no.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.560
I'm just going to fucking kill you.
Why?

21:20.560 --> 21:26.040
Because you told some spotty-faced
blogger that I hit Glen.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.640
But I didn't.
But you would say that.

21:27.640 --> 21:32.080
It can't have been me. I'd know if
it was me. Oh, I can't have been,

21:27.640 --> 21:32.080
I would have known it was me.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.080
Malcolm,
you're really scaring me now.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.480
I'm scaring you? I'm so
sorry I'm fucking scaring you.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.720
I mustn't scare you, must I?

21:39.720 --> 21:42.120
OK, I'll just explain what I'm going
to fucking do to you.

21:42.120 --> 21:46.600
I'm going to take your bollocks,

21:42.120 --> 21:46.600
fucking rip them off,
fucking paint eyeballs on them

21:46.600 --> 21:50.560
and I'm going to
stitch them onto a fucking sock
and use that as our mouthpiece.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.400
Hope this is real vinegar.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.200
Sure you don't want a chip?

21:59.720 --> 22:01.720
Do you know any jokes?

22:01.720 --> 22:05.560
I'll tell you what, the
chips down south are a joke.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.000
I'll text me mate,
I'll see if she knows any.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.480
You texting her now then,
your friend? No, I'm tweeting.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.920
Tweeting? You mean like Twitter?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.240
Just, er...

22:21.240 --> 22:23.560
just want to get a pickled egg.
Hang on a sec.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.640
Hi, Terri. Hi, listen, it's Julie.

22:26.640 --> 22:31.120
She tweets. Hang on.
Julie tweets, what does that mean?

22:31.120 --> 22:34.160
Twitter. Tweets on Twitter.
It's like a social networking site.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.200
You type in a text but it goes to
anybody and anyone can access it.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.880
And she's tweeting now, is she?
'She's tweeted.'

22:40.880 --> 22:42.920
Right, find out what she's saying.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.840
Hello. She's singing like a canary.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.960
She's twittering about Terri.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.600
Listen, it's too hot for me here.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.680
I've got to get out. All right.
Look, I want out, Nicola.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.880
OK, Terri, calm down,
I'm going to ring Malcolm.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.080
This is no good for fucking pacing.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.000
Malcolm, Nicola. Julie tweets.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.040
Tweets on Twitter, say she's on
Twitter. She tweets on Twitter.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.520
Christ on a cross trainer, Nicola,
Julie's the fucking leak.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.120
I told you.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.720
Get her back here right now
so I can loofah her to death.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.800
Oh, what a day.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.120
Is that her? Oh, no, two blokes.
Are you sure you don't want one?

23:25.120 --> 23:27.400
You mightn't get another
chance to eat all day.

23:27.400 --> 23:31.520
That is literally mashed up
Dalmatian head and sawdust,

23:31.520 --> 23:33.720
you know that? Is it?

23:33.720 --> 23:36.120
On the other hand
I am fucking starving.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.920
Oh, here comes checkpoint Charlie.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.840
She's over there.
I'm really sorry, Terri.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.480
Yes, well the apology's noted.
Noted. Not accepted.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.160
No, not accepted, noted.
Oh, you look awful.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.760
Thanks. Do you want a chip?

23:51.760 --> 23:53.600
I haven't got time for chips, Glen.

23:53.600 --> 23:58.000
This is open territory, I'm
a sitting duck, I have to get out.
I know. Let's go, let's go.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.720
No-one recognises you. She's over
there. OK, we'll look after her.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.840
Come in, ladies.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.200
Home again, home again, jiggedy jig.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.400
Right, I'm just
going to use the loo.

24:08.400 --> 24:12.000
Right, OK. Julie. Yeah?
Would you like a cup of tea?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.240
Well, I might as well, there's
bugger all else to do. Okey doke.

24:15.240 --> 24:19.840
Squeeze my cock and call me Nancy,
were you born in a barn, Glen?

24:19.840 --> 24:24.440
Keep the door and your arse cheeks
fucking tightly closed, right.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.480
Jesus Christ that's a tiny kettle
that, but you know what they say.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.640
Where's glummy mummy?
Ah, she's having a pee.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.920
Julie, how are you doing, all right?

24:31.920 --> 24:34.080
Yeah, I'm great.
Busy, busy, busy. Lovely.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.560
Oh, fucking hell, Malcolm.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.520
Julie, darling, can we just
have a wee word with you?

24:40.520 --> 24:42.920
Why? What's going on?

24:42.920 --> 24:45.920
Do you know a guy called Rob Holt?

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
I've never heard of him.
Why? What's this about?

24:47.920 --> 24:52.000
Well, it's just that he's one of
your followers on Twitter? Twitter.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.120
And I think that some of your...

24:54.120 --> 24:56.280
Tweets.
The tweets that you've been doing...

24:56.280 --> 24:59.360
Yeah? They've actually been
reported out there.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.720
What are you accusing us of? No, no,

24:59.360 --> 25:02.720
we're not accusing you of anything.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.640
You look like you're
accusing us of something.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.120
You fucking sound like you are.
No, no, no. I've seen Spooks.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.320
You have treated me
like a bag of shit all day.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.320
I mean I'm a very,
very patient person but
I've had yous lot up to here.

25:16.320 --> 25:20.160
I should've known not to
trust yous lot when yous fucked
over the Metric Martyrs.

25:20.160 --> 25:25.440
All I was trying to do
was right by my Jason, right,
and if he was here now

25:25.440 --> 25:29.120
he'd be fucking appalled
by the way yous lot are carrying on.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.480
He always said you were
a useless bunch of wankers.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.560
Oh, hello. Oh, you're back.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.400
Excellent. Ha.
Every epic needs a hero.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.000
Put tiny kettle on, lad, I'm gasping.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.800
Everything OK?
What's, er, what's going on?

25:42.800 --> 25:47.520
Ah, Malcolm, er, if you could
just come to the toilet with me.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.320
Get rid of her. OK.

25:53.320 --> 25:59.360
We go out there, we say our goodbyes
and we'll get Glen to go and
do the fucking desert burial, OK?

25:59.360 --> 26:01.280
Yeah. You just try
and compose yourself.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.320
OK. OK? Yeah.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.480
Julie... Get rid of the
Geordie Pauline Fowler.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.520
Put her on a train back to shit town
or wherever the fuck she came from.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.840
Right, would you like
to come with me?

26:14.840 --> 26:16.440
Ah, there's been a change of plan.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.880
I'm taking them for the train.

26:20.880 --> 26:26.320
No wonder the country's gone to
the fucking dogs. You. You two.

26:20.880 --> 26:26.320
You'll not be there for long.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.120
OK, do we have anything
that we can use against her?

26:31.120 --> 26:33.920
There's the Metric Martyr stuff.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.920
That is right wing, that's really,
that is an insanity signifier.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.760
Fruit by the pound? Well...
That's what I've got to work with?

26:40.760 --> 26:43.200
Fuck's sake. Fruit by the pound.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.760
Watch and fucking learn, OK.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.120
We say we're dropping her
because of extremist views, right?

26:48.120 --> 26:51.560
And just don't mention that those
extreme views are how she feels

26:51.560 --> 26:55.280
about the fucking finer points of
fruit and fucking veg merchandising.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.080
You shouldn't work
for that lot, you know.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.520
I know. I know. They're all nobs.
I don't really, you know.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.000
Did you enjoy anything
about today? Na.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
You've taken out all the
references to the People's Champion?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.960
Yep. Yep, yep, and I've added a
whole page on Manyon's holiday...

27:09.960 --> 27:11.680
Yeah, good. Plus, jokes.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.400
Funny jokes. Funny jokes.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.600
Funny jokes. I'm a funny man. I

27:13.400 --> 27:17.600
have my texts read out on Five Live.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.640
They're good. Is it done?
Glen, what have you touched?
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.080
Christ, the wifi's out.
What page were we up to?

27:24.080 --> 27:25.800
Eight. Excellent.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.080
You're watching Nicola's speech
with me and Angela?

27:28.080 --> 27:32.080
You're my brother from another
mother. That's the kind of thing

27:28.080 --> 27:32.080
we do. Sounds like fun.

27:32.080 --> 27:36.600
It will be fun, I've ordered some
punch. You better get a move on,

27:32.080 --> 27:36.600
you're late. I know. I know.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.200
Right, grab the speech. Let's go.
There you go. Good luck.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.920
Thank you.
Fingers crossed. Have fun.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.240
They grow up so fast, eh?

27:43.240 --> 27:46.200
Right go, go, go, go. Go.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.360
How did the vodcast
with Helen Mirren go?

27:48.360 --> 27:51.280
Yo, twat features. Hang on.
Hang on. I mean that literally.

27:51.280 --> 27:55.840
There's this Julie Price woman,
turns out she's a little bit
fucking unstable, you know,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
extremist views.
We'll have to let her go.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.200
Of course. It's just that, er...

28:00.200 --> 28:01.960
Andrew Dover, the blogger...

28:01.960 --> 28:05.520
He's just going to go and spread
that over the internet, yeah?

28:01.960 --> 28:05.520
Well, probably.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.000
Job done.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.800
I'm away for a game of crazy golf.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.320
Love those fucking windmills.

28:10.320 --> 28:14.320
Hit the full stops.
Don't run through anything. I don't
know what that means. Stop.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.640
Stop at the full stops,
it will sound good in the hall.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.440
I won't gabble. What if they boo me?

28:18.440 --> 28:22.640
'But local people
finding their own solutions...'

28:22.640 --> 28:27.080
She looks lovely.
'Having a real say over the future
of the places where they live.'

28:27.080 --> 28:29.080
Well done. Well done, indeed.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.360
Some lovely stuff in there,
I thought. Yeah.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.960
I thought it was pretty
good, actually, yeah.

28:33.960 --> 28:38.000
Praise indeed from the Scottish
Simon Cowell. Ha ha. Ah, thank you.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.240
What happened to the jokes?
I didn't say the jokes.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.920
Glen may have given me
the wrong number.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.600
We missed a whole page of
Manyon jokes.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.360
Not my fault.

28:46.360 --> 28:50.840
You said we were up to eight,
I printed from nine. You said

28:46.360 --> 28:50.840
where are we up to, I said eight.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.200
But we were up to seven. You should
have gone from eight.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.280
You went from nine?

28:54.280 --> 28:58.680
That would've been good, it would
have just added a bit of Bob Hope

28:54.280 --> 28:58.680
to all the doom and the gloom.

28:59.680 --> 29:03.640
Maybe next time, eh?

28:59.680 --> 29:03.640
Well, you said we were up to page
eight but we were in fact up to...

29:03.640 --> 29:04.920
No I didn't. I said FROM eight.
