WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.520
This programme contains
strong language.

00:04.520 --> 00:08.720
It's up to the PM. I'll go wherever
he wants. Bye-bye. Morning. Morning,

00:04.520 --> 00:08.720
Minister.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.040
You just off to
your 8.30 with Malcolm?

00:11.040 --> 00:12.840
Yep. First one.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.640
Into the lion's den. Viper's pit.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.720
The belly of the beast.
The lair of the white worm.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.480
The eye of the snake. Mm.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.720
Not all of departments get
asked to the 8.30. That's true.

00:22.720 --> 00:27.800
So it's a great honour to be there
with the big hitters. Always best to

00:22.720 --> 00:27.800
be inside the tent pissing out.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.680
Absolutely. If you were doing this
at Environment and Rural Affairs,

00:27.800 --> 00:31.680
8.30,

00:31.680 --> 00:35.880
you'd be very much outside the tent,
wouldn't you?
Probably at Coffee Republic.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.480
Covered in piss.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.480
Yeah. Good luck. You'll be fine.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.680
You don't need good luck. Yeah.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.200
What about the...piss?
No, no, no, it's just

00:40.680 --> 00:44.200
a figure of speech.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.800
I'd better go. See you later, Robyn.
OK. I'm sure there's a way of..

00:47.800 --> 00:49.720
Robyn? Robyn, sorry.

00:49.720 --> 00:55.440
Could you try and pick up any signals
you can from Malcolm about...about...

00:55.440 --> 00:57.560
..about the reshuffle, you know.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.880
I've really got to go now
cos I'm going to be late.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.800
Yeah, God, don't be late!
Apparently they shout
things at the last one in.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.560
If anyone shouts at you,
they'll have to answer to me.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.480
I'll box his ears.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.960
Box his ears?

01:12.960 --> 01:16.760
If that was flirting, that was
absolutely crap. Why? Box his ears?

01:16.760 --> 01:18.920
How long is it since you've had sex?

01:18.920 --> 01:23.640
That is between me and my
internet service provider.

01:18.920 --> 01:23.640
Anyway about this morning...

01:23.640 --> 01:25.640
You've actually gone red, Glenn.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.840
You have. You've gone red.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.760
I have not gone red. That's red.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.360
Yeah.
Look, he can hardly walk properly.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.800
Morning, morning, morning. Morning.
OK, I want to have a
little bit of a think

01:37.800 --> 01:41.360
about some of our presentational
issues with regard to yesterday.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.360
There seems to have been a bit
of a problem last night with
Liam on Newsnight.

01:45.360 --> 01:50.560
I would like to know, why did we
have a minister on last night who
did not appear to know the lines?

01:50.560 --> 01:54.640
It's not his fault. We grilled him
before... Grilled him?
He's got a new baby...

01:54.640 --> 01:57.759
I don't care if he's got a new baby.
I don't care if he's tired.

01:57.759 --> 02:01.080
He looked like he didn't know
what he was fucking talking about.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.880
He doesn't know what he
was fucking talking about, but he's
got to appear as if he does, right?

02:05.880 --> 02:10.120
And that is your job and your job
yours, yours, yours, and yours,

02:05.880 --> 02:10.120
yours, and yours.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.120
For all your respective ministers.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.880
Give them the lines. Right?

02:14.880 --> 02:17.720
Yep. Give them all the lines to say?

02:17.720 --> 02:21.400
This is the delightful Robyn.
She's just with us today.

02:21.400 --> 02:27.040
She's standing in for Terri Coverley
at the Department of Social Affairs.
So let's be gentle with her, please.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.960
No remarks about the Department of
Stuffed Anuses or the Department

02:30.960 --> 02:34.600
of Stupid Announcements,
or the Department of Sod All.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.560
Right, next. Reshuffle?

02:37.560 --> 02:41.960
Yes, there is a pending reshuffle.
I can see we're not going to
get anything past you.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.480
There was a young girl from DOSA
who helped herself to a samosa...

02:46.480 --> 02:48.920
Ah! No, next time.
Sorry, just a bit of fun.

02:48.920 --> 02:54.320
Um, yes, the reshuffle.
No, yes, well, definitely...
We don't know anything.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.960
I don't know anything, so, um,
we can't say anything, but even

02:57.960 --> 03:02.560
if we did, we wouldn't, but we
don't, so we both can't and won't.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.360
Last cabinet before reshuffle.
What do you think? Should I go
in there with all guns blazing,

03:07.360 --> 03:11.680
new policy ideas and do a big sort
of ha-cha-cha-cha-cha, you know?

03:11.680 --> 03:16.040
Or should I be more "mmm", like
Buddha? You don't have to do either.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.079
You could just sort of nod quietly,
nod wisely every so often and just,

03:20.079 --> 03:23.040
have a policy in your back
pocket just in case you feel...

03:23.040 --> 03:25.800
OK. What's the policy
I've got in my back pocket?

03:25.800 --> 03:30.040
Tripling the number of quiet
carriages on intercity trains.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.880
Oh, wow, what a big exciting
hard-on moment that's going to be.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.640
That's not bad at all. Did you just
think of that? Straight out of there.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.760
Hugh, after Cabinet,
you are going to...

03:41.760 --> 03:46.800
Talk to Tucker about the reshuffle.
Yeah. I'll pop in and just slip
it in during the conversation.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.840
Good. Much as you

03:46.800 --> 03:49.840
intended to do with Robyn, I suspect.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.680
Right, next.
What about Julius Nicholson?

03:52.680 --> 03:57.240
I got it yesterday he was looking
at the MoD taking over UK
security from the Home Office.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.600
That was flown by one of Nicholson's
mob. I'm spending half my time

04:00.600 --> 04:03.960
dealing with this rubbish
that Nicholson's putting out there.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.920
There's a Sunday
piece in the pipeline about you
and him not getting along.

04:07.920 --> 04:12.080
I wondered if you'd got a line.
Julius Nicholson is a hugely

04:07.920 --> 04:12.080
respected adviser.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.160
He now has a wide-ranging brief
and his blue-sky vision and

04:15.160 --> 04:18.959
helicopter thinking will enable this
government to go,

04:18.959 --> 04:22.600
in his own phrase,
"beyond delivery and beyond that".

04:22.600 --> 04:28.080
That's the line, OK? And if he does
stick his baldy head round your door
and comes up with some stupid idea

04:28.080 --> 04:33.400
about policemen's helmets should be
yellow or let's set up
a department to count the moon,

04:33.400 --> 04:37.560
just treat him like someone with
Alzheimer's disease, you know?

04:37.560 --> 04:40.320
Just say to him,
"Oh, yeah, that's lovely.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.440
"We must talk about that later," OK?

04:42.440 --> 04:45.520
In no way, shape or form
is it going to have...

04:42.440 --> 04:45.520
KNOCK AT DOOR

04:45.520 --> 04:47.560
Come the fuck in or
fuck the fuck off.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.760
I'll come the fuck in, then.
It's just something that
Nicholson's flown.

04:51.760 --> 04:56.360
It's a kind of brain exercise, like,
"What would it be like if men had

04:51.760 --> 04:56.360
tits?" You know?

04:56.360 --> 04:58.880
Mark Mardell, yeah.
That's very good actually.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.680
All right then, see you then. Hugh.
I thought you would want to
know as soon as possible. What?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.080
Terri's dad... Yeah?

05:06.080 --> 05:10.680
No news at the moment.
Right, so you've come to talk about
the reshuffle? Yeah, I have.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.480
Yeah? In terms of shuffly stuff,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.880
how is Neil? I mean,

05:15.880 --> 05:17.720
is his heart...?

05:17.720 --> 05:20.440
Have you not heard? No.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.080
He's paralysed. Oh, no.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.640
Neil's on wheels.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.000
You're kidding. He's a vegetable.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.320
Oh, my God. Yeah.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.280
Mind you, that means you could have
his department. You are kidding.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.280
Well, fuck you very much.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.440
I know you're looking for

05:37.280 --> 05:41.440
mouth-to-mouth on the reshuffle,

05:37.280 --> 05:41.440
but I know nothing.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.800
The PM is still working it out
on the back of a Coldplay CD
as we speak. Are you in, sir?

05:45.800 --> 05:52.120
Oh, this is Julius Nicholson. Hello.
Nice to see you again. What
proposals have you got for us today?

05:52.120 --> 05:53.800
How about a ban on sandcastles?

05:53.800 --> 05:57.960
No, I just wanted to find
out if you're coming to my

05:53.800 --> 05:57.960
FSG briefing this afternoon.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.440
FSG briefing?
Forward Strategy Group.

06:00.440 --> 06:05.320
Well, you know, Julius, I think
I'm just going to have to send one
of the boys.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.440
I have got so much work to do here,
what with this...

06:08.440 --> 06:09.960
Well... .the MoD.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.880
As the minister said to the prince,
"Don't be surprised if
we abolish you."

06:13.880 --> 06:15.400
I'll leave it with you.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.360
That was a bit, um...

06:20.360 --> 06:24.360
Are you all right? I'm fucking
all right. I can fucking look

06:20.360 --> 06:24.360
after myself.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.560
Under the spotlight now, aren't you?

06:24.360 --> 06:28.560
Well, you should
just watch your own back,

06:28.560 --> 06:32.760
what with the missus dripping poison
into the big guy's ear about you.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.760
What missus?

06:32.760 --> 06:35.680
The Prime Minister's missus.
Oh, you don't know?

06:35.680 --> 06:40.520
She doesn't like the cut of
your jib, son. She doesn't...
She's hardly seen my jib.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.720
I just had a conversation with her
at the New Year's party, that's all.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.680
Why doesn't she like me?
I mean, what's not to like?

06:47.680 --> 06:51.960
You just didn't click.
We couldn't click! We were
talking about the fucking Euro!

06:51.960 --> 06:57.480
How are you supposed to click over
the Euro? It's fucking impossible.

06:51.960 --> 06:57.480
Don't take it so personally.

06:57.480 --> 07:02.880
You're telling me she
doesn't like me as a person! How else
am I supposed to take it?

07:02.880 --> 07:06.600
Robyn, can you send these back to
archives cos they're just not even...

07:06.600 --> 07:09.920
It's not highlighted. I'm not gonna
plough through that myself.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.280
I also
need the last four months of the
European Digest. I'll...

07:13.280 --> 07:16.800
Is it because you fancy me?
Is that what this is all about?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.200
Sorry?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.200
Why you're so bloody rude to me.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.560
That's got to be the reason. Other
people, when they come in here,

07:22.560 --> 07:27.280
they knock and they say
"hello", "good morning", "thank you"
and "nice top" sometimes.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.400
Right, um... Well, no. I mean,
for a start, I don't fancy you.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.080
I don't know where you got that,
but it's best to get it out
of your head.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.600
If I'm slightly polite to you,
on a semi-regular basis, will that,
in any way bypass it?

07:39.600 --> 07:43.440
That would definitely do it.
Well, thank you
very much for the work you do.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.080
Hi, by the way, how are you?

07:45.080 --> 07:47.440
I'm very well actually.
You look lovely.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.680
Thank you. Can I have
the fucking digest, please?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.280
That would be terrific.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.840
All you had to do was ask, please.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.840
Yeah, well, all I did do was ask.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.680
Phwoar! It was a joke.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.920
Hello. Hello.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.920
Um... Morning, Minister.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.040
Um, I need to have a
word with you, Ollie.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.400
Then can you get me Terri on the
phone, please? Where is Glenn?

08:07.400 --> 08:10.200
Er, Nicholson hauled him
in for one of his chats.

08:10.200 --> 08:16.560
Oh. One of his bright ideas for
inflatable churches for rural

08:10.200 --> 08:16.560
communities or tattooing immigrants.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.200
Apparently,
the PM's wife doesn't like me.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.920
Did you know this?

08:20.920 --> 08:24.200
No. Um...why?

08:24.200 --> 08:27.320
Well, two reasons - cut of my jib
and insufficient clicking.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.280
So I'll be a minor footnote
in British political history

08:30.280 --> 08:36.120
cos I didn't have an anecdote about
Charlotte Church's puppies. We can

08:30.280 --> 08:36.120
brainstorm small-talk...

08:36.120 --> 08:41.520
Ollie, realistically, I'm not going
to get promotion, not while
this Prime Minister's still in power?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.920
Not while he's married to this wife.
Mind you, knowing your luck,

08:44.920 --> 08:47.440
he'll leave her, she'll
marry his replacement.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.640
I did mention your great
quiet carriages thing and he just...

08:50.640 --> 08:54.080
..went, you know. What does
that mean? Fuck knows what it means,

08:54.080 --> 08:57.160
but I don't think it means, "Oh,
Hugh, you're fantastic.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.840
"Here, become Home Secretary," and
even if it did mean that, when he's

09:00.840 --> 09:05.400
in bed tonight with Mrs PM,
she'll say, "What do you mean
Hugh Abbott as Home Secretary?

09:05.400 --> 09:09.520
"The man is a social spastic and
very probably a registered nonce,

09:05.400 --> 09:09.520
darling."

09:09.520 --> 09:12.640
Terri on line one, and
there's her dad's name.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.320
All right. Dad's name? Hell...hello.

09:15.320 --> 09:19.200
Hello, how are you?

09:15.320 --> 09:19.200
'I'm not great actually, Hugh...'

09:19.200 --> 09:25.320
Yes, goodness me. Please be
sure to send my best to...to...

09:25.320 --> 09:27.520
to your dad.

09:27.520 --> 09:32.440
Look, I heard today that the
PM's wife doesn't like me.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.080
Did you know about this?
'Yeah, I did know that.'

09:35.080 --> 09:39.760
I know about the lack of click.
Was there anything else? 'Hugh,

09:35.080 --> 09:39.760
my dad is dying.'

09:39.760 --> 09:44.160
Of course. Thanks so much for taking
the time to talk to me Terri, really.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.520
It must be a...you know...
Well, obviously, it's a very,
very hard time for you and,

09:48.520 --> 09:52.800
it's just ironic that it happens to
have coincided with
such a very hard time for me.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.000
Because, you know, I thought I
was solid with the reshuffle.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
But, er, now, you know with the not
clicking bombshell...

09:59.000 --> 10:03.480
I need to give the
impression that I'm not budging,
I'm staying exactly where I am,

10:03.480 --> 10:06.600
you know, I'm here for ever,
like, you know, like, um...

10:06.600 --> 10:08.320
like Ken, um...

10:08.320 --> 10:10.640
Livingstone? Russell?

10:10.640 --> 10:13.080
Hom? Barlow?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.920
Barlow, like Ken Barlow, I'm solid.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.800
Fucking arse clap. Robyn...

10:18.800 --> 10:23.920
Look, I don't want to say
this too many times, but the
fact is Nicholson's shafted us.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.520
He's cut us out of
the 8.30 briefings.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.400
That's awful.
Yes, I know, but for now, this

10:29.400 --> 10:35.080
department is no longer going to
any of Malcolm's 8.30 briefings, OK?
Tomorrow morning, I just stay here?

10:36.600 --> 10:41.080
That's right. I don't want
to alarm Hugh... God, this gets
worse! Listen to me, Robyn.

10:41.080 --> 10:46.440
He's got quite enough on his mind
at the moment, so tomorrow morning,
what you do is you leave here at

10:46.440 --> 10:51.280
the same time, about 8.20 and you
fuck off out of and go
and sit in a park or something, OK?

10:51.280 --> 10:53.760
Not tell Hugh?
Yes. It's only temporary.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.440
I'm going to sort it out.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.480
Won't it just be a bit demeaning?

10:57.480 --> 11:02.360
Terri says there's a list of
Question Time producers in her top
desk drawer. Are you OK, Robyn?

11:02.360 --> 11:06.040
Um, yeah. Have you been touching

11:02.360 --> 11:06.040
her inappropriately?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.480
Fuck off. Yes, I've got
the producer's names, so

11:09.480 --> 11:16.000
thanks for that and is there anything
else, though, that I could do, like

11:09.480 --> 11:16.000
photo ops or, er, a little party?

11:16.000 --> 11:20.880
Schmooze the broadsheets, you
know, tell them how much I love
running social affairs.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.240
'Whatever, whatever.' Yeah,

11:20.880 --> 11:25.240
that would work wouldn't it? Everyone
loves a party?

11:25.240 --> 11:30.480
Yeah. Well, I don't personally, but

11:25.240 --> 11:30.480
people do. Get your head round this.
You'll go to a park. Which park?

11:30.480 --> 11:33.760
Just choose... Green Park.
I don't like Green Park.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.960
Which park do you like?
St James's Park.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.240
Right, you go to St
James's Park, then, OK?

11:39.240 --> 11:43.640
I think we should tell the Minister.
Listen, Robyn, I really
like you, but fuck off!

11:43.640 --> 11:46.400
Has he been touching you
inappropriately again?

11:46.400 --> 11:49.720
Don't you start.
Oh, God, I'm rubbish, apparently.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.320
That's why Nicholson has banned
us from the 8.30 meetings,
and I've got to go and sit in

11:54.320 --> 11:58.200
St James's Park and pretend I'm in a
meeting drinking coffee all morning.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.680
I wouldn't worry. There should be
about five of you there doing that.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.960
Oh, God! This is just another
example of thinking out of the box

12:04.960 --> 12:10.600
by someone who's clearly out of
his fucking tree. I've got to go.

12:04.960 --> 12:10.600
I'll talk to you later, OK, bye.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.840
Malcolm Tucker. Julius Nicholson,
what can I do you for?

12:13.840 --> 12:16.520
I am keen to have a chat with
Keith Percival.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.440
Yeah, er, that won't be possible.

12:19.440 --> 12:23.080
And I need to read
the O'Rourke papers. I'm afraid
not. Anything else?

12:24.760 --> 12:28.720
Look, Malcolm,
you and I both know full well that
my power and authority

12:28.720 --> 12:34.320
flows directly from the PM. If
you've got a problem... Keith is so

12:28.720 --> 12:34.320
busy with real governmental work

12:34.320 --> 12:38.200
that he doesn't have time to discuss
with you your ideas and theories.

12:38.200 --> 12:42.840
The O'Rourke papers
are not relevant to anything we can
actually action at this moment.

12:42.840 --> 12:47.360
That's slightly funny because
when I played tennis with the PM,
which I do, as you know,

12:47.360 --> 12:51.800
every Sunday, he was saying
just how much he was looking

12:47.360 --> 12:51.800
forward to seeing that paper.

12:51.800 --> 12:57.640
He does think that your theories
are interesting. He tells me that

12:51.800 --> 12:57.640
because I see him every day.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.640
I also see him on a Sunday
when I see his family and I make
the fucking waffles.

13:01.640 --> 13:06.160
But I cannot allow you to come
in here

13:06.160 --> 13:09.880
and interfere with the
actual process of government.

13:09.880 --> 13:14.200
Malcolm, that is my job.
That is what is happening.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.280
Malcolm, Malcolm, sorry, there are
going to be big changes around here.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.760
Are there? Get used to it. We'll
announce all this at the reshuffle.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.720
With all due respect, Julius, the
reshuffle is the business of the PM,

13:25.720 --> 13:28.800
and the PM alone, which means
that is my business, my remit.

13:28.800 --> 13:34.960
Malcolm, historically yes,
but now it's part of my remit.
OK, I'll tell you what we should do.

13:34.960 --> 13:41.960
Why don't we just get our remits
out, slap them on the table and see
who's got the biggest fucking remit?

13:41.960 --> 13:46.200
Malcolm,
we need to talk about accommodation,
we need to talk about access...

13:46.200 --> 13:50.480
Accommodation? Why am I
talking about accommodation?
It's a 21-man department.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.880
We can't fit upstairs.
This is ideal.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.480
21 men in here?

13:54.480 --> 13:57.040
Not just in here, no.
This office here... Yeah.

13:57.040 --> 14:02.280
..will be perfectly usable for not
only myself... That's not an office.

13:57.040 --> 14:02.280
It is an office. It's a pantry.

14:02.280 --> 14:07.560
Whatever it is, we will refit this
out as a working office and...
Julius, it's a fucking pantry, look.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.240
So what? What we'll do
is we will kick through this,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.320
bang, straight into
the PM's private study.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.640
What are people going to say

14:15.640 --> 14:19.120
when they come in and they say,
"Where is Julius Nicholson?"

14:19.120 --> 14:23.920
I'm here. He's in the pantry! Here I
am. They're going to ridicule you.

14:19.120 --> 14:23.920
They'll start saying...

14:23.920 --> 14:28.320
Why would they ridicule me
over the fact... "Where's the
bankrupt in the cupboard?"

14:28.320 --> 14:31.160
Why are you behaving like
a complete and utter prick?

14:31.160 --> 14:36.080
I'm supposed to polish you up,
burnish you up, when get your

14:31.160 --> 14:36.080
big break and you're on fucking

14:36.080 --> 14:39.800
Call My Bluff or whatever it is, I'm
supposed to be... Come back in here!

14:39.800 --> 14:43.440
Hey, come back in here!
Julius, get the fuck back in here!

14:44.960 --> 14:47.840
Please, please, come back.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.640
Let's be civilised.
Let's be civilised about it.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.440
Let's be civilised.
There are human resources outside.
There are human resources outside.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.360
Go over to your
fucking pantry, right. This
is a perfectly usable office space.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.200
Cool it for one minute, OK?
Cool it and just fucking...

15:03.200 --> 15:05.400
Cool it, shut up
and fucking listen to me.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.320
This is an old fucking Georgian
door. Do you know how long
this has been here?

15:09.320 --> 15:12.440
No idea. Since the time of
Elizabeth I, at least. Look.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.840
That does not open.
Look at it. Try opening it.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.920
Surely what stuff you like. Malcolm!
Character-building.
Team-building.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.800
Put your hand there, try to open it.
It's a pantry. It's my fucking
pantry. Open the fucking door.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.720
Try! What's wrong, you
don't want to touch it?

15:26.720 --> 15:31.520
I was at the Woolsey with
Emma. Emma, that's still your
opposition bit of skirt, is it?

15:31.520 --> 15:36.280
Yeah. Don't say bit of skirt, Hugh,
makes you sound like Sid James.
Minister, good morning.

15:36.280 --> 15:40.440
Good morning. Hello. You off for the

15:36.280 --> 15:40.440
8.30? Yep, into the house
of the snakes.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.800
Sorry. Grass snakes are
benign, aren't they?

15:42.800 --> 15:47.720
Can you,
can you try, really try, you know,
to get the goss on the re-shuffle?

15:47.720 --> 15:51.120
I don't really care
how desperate you look at this point.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.720
So don't pussyfoot around.
OK, I will really
give it a go this time.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.560
Thanks. I thought you'd be up all
night doing the invitations
for my party.

15:58.560 --> 16:03.560
Don't worry about that, look.
I am desperate, I don't really want
to look desperate, like Glenn.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.960
God, here we go again.
Yeah, like Glenn what?

16:05.960 --> 16:09.920
Well, I was just saying, the
last time you saw a snatch was...

16:09.920 --> 16:13.880
Basic instinct.
You see that's good.
That's the kind of repartee

16:13.880 --> 16:18.840
I need with the PM's wife.
It's that final "k-tsss", you
see, that's the bit I'm missing.

16:18.840 --> 16:23.640
Yeah, I think you could drop
the snatch material with the

16:18.840 --> 16:23.640
PM's wife, don't you? Well, OK.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.080
Between the snatch and the Euro
there's some sort of happy medium.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.760
Morning, morning, morning.
What's the story in
Bala-fucking-mory?

16:30.760 --> 16:35.200
Who can tell me the issues
of the moment? First to answer wins
a big massive boat.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.840
Alicia,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.840
she says Nicholson is squelching

16:42.840 --> 16:46.000
his way through the building,
so we're on standby at least.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.800
Can't we just kill him?
What about just firing him
at a wall from a cannon?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.480
Just a wall two feet away so he...

16:51.480 --> 16:55.560
We force-feed him a mixture of
garlic and Dettol in Cupasoup.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.280
What about the old red hot poker

16:55.560 --> 16:59.280
up the arse, Edward II?

16:59.280 --> 17:01.800
I'd like to nail him to
a tree through the head

17:01.800 --> 17:08.319
and watch lice slowly crawl over
his body eating off all the flesh

17:01.800 --> 17:08.319
in a slow and painful death.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.520
But that rather bitter anomaly
aside, most of the responses

17:11.520 --> 17:16.680
to the Warwick report press cuttings
were pretty, pretty positive.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.560
Hello, Julius. Morning, Julius.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.200
Just do that.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.000
Right. Would you like a cup of tea?

17:28.000 --> 17:32.320
No, no, I am bouncing! So
what I'm going to suggest, if I may?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.360
Cupasoup? Not for me no.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.720
I'm hoping to go over the ASBOs.

17:36.720 --> 17:41.480
Are there any ASBOs processed
on this site, actioned or
processed on this site? No.

17:41.480 --> 17:47.120
No, this is the ministry, everything
is done over at Richmond Terrace.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.560
Just get my pen out.
Richmond...House is it?

17:50.560 --> 17:52.200
Terrace. Terrace.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.720
Sorry, OK, so that's... well.

17:54.720 --> 18:00.400
We've been bouncing around about
this for the last couple of weeks
really. I'd like to have seen that.

18:00.400 --> 18:05.840
..and we've got five Whitehall
departments having some sort of

18:00.400 --> 18:05.840
impact upon the ASBO process.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.480
We've got Lord Chancellor's,
DWP, Department of Health.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.120
We take those away, so...

18:12.120 --> 18:15.560
as, if, out of the five you've got,
let's put three with you.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.440
So out of the five,
three are there.

18:17.440 --> 18:22.680
Glenn's got custody of those
three for the time being. Two, four,
six billion pounds there.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.960
I take two away,
so they come back to me.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.520
I put that four billion
straight through to the Treasury.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.680
We're left with the one,
that's a two billion pound figure,

18:31.680 --> 18:34.800
which we can spread across
the money saving departments and

18:34.800 --> 18:39.360
that's good news for Number Ten,
good news for the Treasury
and good news for Hugh Abbott.

18:39.360 --> 18:44.600
So that's where we are, I will...
I shall leave that with you.
Interesting thought.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.640
Within a few sort of...

18:48.160 --> 18:53.160
I guess, months,
we'll have something concrete to,
to put to you. See you later.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.640
All right. Bye. Bye.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.120
Er... yes. Where were we?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.920
He really is... this is dangerous.

18:59.920 --> 19:04.040
He is actually unhinged.
But he's relatively harmless,
isn't he? If he's...

19:04.040 --> 19:07.840
No, he's not harmless, because,
because this job's my livelihood.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.360
And ours.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.920
My children's shoes depend
on, now, having a madman suggest...
you know.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.160
But do your children
need two shoes each?

19:17.160 --> 19:21.120
He is not getting anywhere near my
fucking pantry, I'll tell you that.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.040
That door is staying as open
as a fat whore's bone hole.

19:24.720 --> 19:28.320
Sorry I'm late, the traffic was an
absolute bitch, no offence, Robyn.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.480
How about the 8.30? How did that go?

19:30.480 --> 19:34.200
Very quick, in and out. Right,

19:30.480 --> 19:34.200
did you quiz him about the reshuffle?

19:34.200 --> 19:36.800
Um, I didn't get a chance.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.160
I did ask you
specifically to do that...

19:39.160 --> 19:44.080
Hugh, I apologise, entirely my
fault. Er, Robyn give me a printout
and let me have a look at it.

19:44.080 --> 19:48.280
So Question Time up the swanee...

19:44.080 --> 19:48.280
Yeah. What the fuck d'you have to

19:44.080 --> 19:48.280
do to get on TV?

19:48.280 --> 19:52.800
Have sex with a pig, soil yourself?
I don't know the minimum
requirements are any more.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.920
Terri. Hi, how's it going?
'He's gone Hugh.' Oh, dear.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.320
Oh, I am so sorry,
Terri, I really am.

20:03.480 --> 20:07.000
That's, that's really...
That's just, blimey.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.160
OK? You OK now?

20:12.440 --> 20:16.200
SOBBING

20:16.200 --> 20:18.240
Yeah, yep.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.720
Listen, what I was calling about,
we'll forget, forget about that.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.880
There's no need
to talk about that now.

20:23.880 --> 20:27.960
'OK.' Right, because
Question Time has bitten the
dust and I was just going to,

20:27.960 --> 20:31.840
ask you if you could ring around some
of your broadsheet contacts and, um,

20:31.840 --> 20:35.400
make absolutely sure that they're
all coming to my party tonight.

20:35.400 --> 20:41.440
I just wanted to take the
opportunity of saying I really am
sorry that it got awkward with Hugh.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.280
I don't like lying to the
minister, I really don't.

20:44.280 --> 20:47.160
Yes, I do understand all this
sneaking about, you know,

20:47.160 --> 20:49.680
make people think
we're having an affair.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.840
Or something. You're joking? Well...

20:55.840 --> 20:57.720
They think we're having an affair?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.920
Well.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.720
God!

21:02.720 --> 21:04.240
It's a grave matter isn't it?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.280
Yeah.
Not a good day to bury bad news.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.800
No. Oh, fuck!

21:08.800 --> 21:10.640
Julius, what a surprise.

21:10.640 --> 21:15.920
What a surprise. Thank goodness
you didn't stumble on us burning a
whole load of money on a big bonfire.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.520
Right. Well done on the
chat we had this morning.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.200
The AIU are going to produce a paper
on this in the next ten to twelve

21:18.520 --> 21:22.200
days.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.760
Raise yourselves a glass.
Happi-ness.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.280
Yes.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.800
Right, well, I'll see you at
this Treasury bash I suppose.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.480
What? The Treasury bash.

21:31.480 --> 21:36.840
The Horseguards Parade thing. Paul
Webster, US Economic Secretary
of State, he's unexpectedly coming

21:36.840 --> 21:40.360
over, and, er, Treasury are hosting
a bash for him this evening.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.040
Don't tell me you've
not been invited.

21:43.040 --> 21:49.360
Yes, no, I have, it's just
that I'm, um, I'm actually

21:43.040 --> 21:49.360
bashing myself tonight. So you,

21:49.360 --> 21:51.400
you've got your own bash, here?

21:51.400 --> 21:53.200
Yep, yep.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.720
Ah, back up everybody.
Put the brakes on.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.240
We've got a bash happening here
tonight and at the Treasury?

21:59.240 --> 22:04.080
Yeah. It sounds complicated,
but I like to maximise my face.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.160
OK, well how many have you invited?

22:06.160 --> 22:11.160
Um, all in I think we've
invited about 150 people.

22:06.160 --> 22:11.160
And how many replies have you had?

22:11.160 --> 22:14.640
Er, about,
I'd say, maybe half a side of A4.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.600
Well, figures, figures, figures.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.920
Twelve. Twelve? Twelve? But we're
expecting to do quite a lot of

22:16.600 --> 22:20.920
business on the door.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.560
So you're feeling a bit "aaarrggh"!

22:23.560 --> 22:25.480
No, no I'm pretty relaxed about it.

22:25.480 --> 22:32.440
I'm feeling sort of "hmmmmm".
Well, you know, it's quite

22:25.480 --> 22:32.440
a healthy turnout.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.160
Healthy turnout, this is
an ill turn out.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.400
I don't recognise any of these
people, this kebab-shop owner,

22:38.400 --> 22:40.920
a child here who's like a
butcher's apprentice.

22:40.920 --> 22:45.720
I mean who is she, Myra Hindley
woman? Look, will you stop whinging?

22:45.720 --> 22:49.000
When this Prime Minister and Imelda
fucking Marcos have gone,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.640
some of these hacks will cease to
be pondlife and have some influence.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.000
Just go in and ingratiate yourself!

22:55.000 --> 22:57.720
...he goes, in fact the PM
told Geoff to get a life,

22:57.720 --> 23:01.080
but apparently he's, er waiting
for the Treasury to clear it.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.880
"K-tssss".

23:02.880 --> 23:08.320
And Julius, Julius Nicholson, says,
"I'm sorry, but I think you'll
find that you're sitting in my seat".

23:08.320 --> 23:11.760
And this was to God, as I
think I mentioned in the set up.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.040
Anyway, have a lovely time.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.560
Fiver if you set off the sprinklers.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.360
You know, if you put Hugh in a
room full of people, he just,

23:17.560 --> 23:21.360
he just clicks.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.640
Sounds like West Side Story. Just...

23:23.640 --> 23:26.120
So who do you work for?
Online Telegraph.

23:26.120 --> 23:30.200
I, um, update the subscription-only
pages on the website.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.080
It's a bit dull really.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.840
And sorry, who are you?

23:33.840 --> 23:37.040
I, I'm not a journalist,
I'm just one of Ollie's mates.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.760
Right.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.240
Angela, hello. Hello. Very nice
to see you. Thank you for coming.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.720
So what's this about the demotion?

23:45.720 --> 23:47.640
Sorry, what, what demotion is that?

23:47.640 --> 23:52.840
Everyone knows that
you're not sending anyone to
Tucker's 8.30's any more.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.000
Sorry, you're saying that, we're not
sending anyone to the 8.30s any more?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.800
Yes. That's what I'm saying.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.440
Yes, yes, yes,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.160
we, yes. Glenn, the 8.30s?

24:06.160 --> 24:10.680
Well, just because, um...

24:10.680 --> 24:12.440
we're not going...

24:12.440 --> 24:17.160
to the 8.30s any more
doesn't mean to say it isn't normal,

24:17.160 --> 24:20.520
interdepartmental practice, because

24:20.520 --> 24:27.440
you know, there just isn't enough
room to get everybody there and it
has to occur on a rotational basis.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.840
You getting all this?
Yes, thanks it'll be on the website.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.640
Why didn't you tell me, Glenn?

24:33.640 --> 24:38.120
What possible reason did you have?
You saw me, I was swinging
like a colostomy bag.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.960
Oh, Hugh, grow up. You did nothing.

24:39.960 --> 24:44.480
There's stuff that happens in
this department every day.
I can't tell you everything.

24:44.480 --> 24:49.320
Since when, Glenn,
does the Secretary of State for
Social Affairs, have to find out

24:49.320 --> 24:55.400
from the fucking press that every
morning at 8.30 I'm being fisted up
to the gall bladder by a bald man?

24:55.400 --> 24:59.480
Oh, yes, my...

24:55.400 --> 24:59.480
Goodnight. Thanks for coming.
Take it easy.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.920
Right guys, thanks very
much for staying on.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.920
Julius Nicholson, right? Yep.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.720
Blue-sky thinker.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.720
Ex-business guru.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.000
Dog rapist. Quite possibly.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.960
He's being a nuisance to me.

25:15.960 --> 25:20.200
He also has got plans to squeeze
your department so hard you'll

25:20.200 --> 25:23.560
be lucky if you're left with one
bollock between the three of you.

25:23.560 --> 25:33.240
So all I am doing here is asking
you, formally, if you will join me
in a little bit of a circle jerk.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.560
Circle jerk, what? It's when a lot
of guys in a circle all, you know...

25:37.560 --> 25:40.440
I assume you don't mean
literally, do you? Presumably?

25:40.440 --> 25:42.920
Tony Mac in the lobby,
you know him, right?

25:42.920 --> 25:46.240
Yeah. Call him, tell him that
you're getting it that Nicholson

25:46.240 --> 25:51.840
is going to get Foreign Sec
in the reshuffle, via a seat. Tony.
Hi, how's it dangling? Yeah?

25:51.840 --> 25:54.240
Listen, I just want to
run something past you.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.840
I wonder if you're hearing...
I've been hearing,

25:56.840 --> 26:00.120
that Nicholson's going to
be getting, er, Foreign Sec.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.920
Hugh, who is your top
mate in the Commentariat?

26:02.920 --> 26:05.400
Colin Sykes? Colin Sykes?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.160
Yeah. That's your top mate? Yeah.

26:07.160 --> 26:11.440
Call him up. Hi Colin. Yes, it's

26:07.160 --> 26:11.440
Hugh Abbott speaking, how are you?

26:11.440 --> 26:16.760
Yeah, you got a decent backhand yet,
have you? Hugh, Hugh Abbott,
we played tennis together.

26:16.760 --> 26:22.560
Yeah. I know it's probably bollocks,

26:16.760 --> 26:22.560
but that's what we all thought when
Jim was up for Home Secretary,

26:22.560 --> 26:26.960
next thing, he's given up the
Columbian Marching Powder
and taken up the Sacraments.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.600
Foreign Secretary is exactly
where he should be.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.240
I mean, he's a smart guy, he
works hard. Cath, yeah,

26:32.240 --> 26:35.480
I dunno where that's come from.
I've been getting that as well.

26:35.480 --> 26:41.280
At one point I think I called him a
dog rapist. Stonewall them, OK,
I'll talk to the boss, right.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.520
Now I've got to phone the

26:41.280 --> 26:44.520
Prime Minister of Great Britain.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.600
Alright, boss?

26:45.600 --> 26:50.360
Yeah, look, I'm really sorry to
interrupt you, but we're getting hit
blind-side down here.

26:50.360 --> 26:54.240
Stuff about Julius Nicholson. Cath
and I's phones are both white hot.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.960
Stuff about him becoming
Foreign Sec. Is there...?

26:56.960 --> 26:59.000
Am I out of the loop here?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.880
The person that's most likely
to be getting his mates

27:01.880 --> 27:05.240
to be putting this kind of stuff
around, is Julius Nicholson.

27:05.240 --> 27:09.600
You put so much hope in them,
and they always let you down.

27:09.600 --> 27:13.160
I think maybe Julius needs to
have his wings clipped a wee bit,

27:13.160 --> 27:17.560
you know? Do you want to do it?

27:17.560 --> 27:21.320
I think you're right.
I think it's better that I
just have a little chat.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.600
I'll see you in the morning. Bye.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.600
Fucking brilliant!

27:27.600 --> 27:29.160
Eight missed messages.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.160
Sleep lightly.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.800
He's incredible.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.600
Colin Sykes didn't know who I was.

27:35.600 --> 27:40.000
I don't know who Colin Sykes is.
There you go. Swings and
roundabouts.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.200
Who am I? Well,

27:40.000 --> 27:44.200
we'll find out tomorrow, won't we?

27:44.200 --> 27:48.000
Morning, morning, morning.
So what's the story
in Bala-fucking-mory?

27:48.000 --> 27:52.440
Reshuffle. Excellent.
You win a year's supply of condoms.
Which in your case is four.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.760
Anything? Fattie's just been in.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.720
You know, he just managed to
squeeze past the policeman.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.840
If you were promoted, good for you.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.040
If it was a relegation, hard cheese.

28:02.040 --> 28:05.760
If he dumps me, I'm going to find
that wife of his

28:05.760 --> 28:09.880
and click her right
through the fucking head. Yeah.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.880
PHONE RINGS

28:09.880 --> 28:13.600
How d'you like this jib, darling?
Bang! That noise is the phone.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.200
I know, I know. I'm in denial.

28:15.200 --> 28:20.640
If you don't know whether or not you
were promoted or relegated, guess
what? You were fucking relegated.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.000
Great. OK, bye-bye.
He wants me to go in.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.760
Just hope it isn't farmers.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.760
I just don't want to
pretend to be nice to farmers.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.800
Knock it out the park!
Yeah, good luck.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.680
Welcome back to lovely
Robyn from the all new,

28:33.680 --> 28:38.760
totally revamped Department of
Social Affairs and Citizenship.

28:33.680 --> 28:38.760
APPLAUSE

28:38.760 --> 28:43.520
I've got no fucking idea what that
means either, but it spells SAC.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.960
Thank you. Thank you very much.
No autographs please.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.240
SAC unfortunately are being

28:46.960 --> 28:50.240
turfed out of their rather tatty

28:50.240 --> 28:55.240
old building, to be replaced
by Julius Nicholson and his

28:50.240 --> 28:55.240
Advanced Implementation Unit.

28:55.240 --> 28:59.240
And onto the broadcast schedule for
today. Colin did Today
which was lovely.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.520
Sweet FA for the World
at One, please, as usual.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.440
You know the lines,
"Most women ever.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.560
"Younger average age
than the AC Milan defence."
