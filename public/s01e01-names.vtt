with these bloody things.
At a time like this, for God's sake!

CLIFF: Um...

Um, Malcolm's there.

CLIFF: Malcolm? Where? In there? In there.
Why?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.320
TERRI: It's just a social call.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.560
CLIFF: A social call? Jesus Christ! Yeah.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.600
CLIFF: Um...have you got him coffee?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.800
TERRI: Did you get him coffee?

00:43.800 --> 00:46.800
CLIFF: I thought you were organising it.
Oh, for Christ...

00:46.800 --> 00:53.040
CLIFF: Get coffee, get, um, danish pastries,
croissants and... Danish pastries,
croissants... No, no, no!

00:53.040 --> 00:57.840

get fruit? A pile of fruit
and lots of coffee. Now! OK?

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
MALCOLM: He's absolutely useless! He is!
He's useless! He's as useless as
a marzipan dildo.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.720
MALCOLM: I've got to go.
The minister's just walked in.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.000
CLIFF: Don't interrupt your call because of
me. You're a minister of the Crown.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.440
HUGH: You don't need to listen
to all of my chutney!

01:16.440 --> 01:19.240
CLIFF: I'm sure it's much, much
more interesting than chutney.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.960
HUGH: No, no, no. It's... It's a...

01:20.960 --> 01:26.480
HUGH: my cock-up, as usual. I thought that
Graham Dixon was doing a briefing,
and it turns out it's Graham Hughes.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.560
HUGH: Too many Grahams around. We ought to
kill some of them.

01:30.560 --> 02:03.160
MALCOLM: Exactly! 

02:03.160 --> 02:08.720
HUGH: Yeah. No, just leave it there.
Thank you, Terri.
There's a lot of them, isn't there?

02:08.720 --> 02:12.480
HUGH: It started with the Telegraph diary,
but just more and more and more.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.640
MALCOLM: Seriously,
the PM likes you personally.

02:15.640 --> 02:22.040
MALCOLM: I like you personally, and we've
absolutely no desire to get rid of
you. I just want you to know that.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.079
MALCOLM: None of this negative stuff
is coming from us.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.400
HUGH: Oh, no, mate. That...

02:30.000 --> 02:33.280
HUGH: ..makes a big difference. Makes me
feel a lot more secure.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.000
MALCOLM: Does it?
Well, it's difficult.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.680
HUGH: What's difficult? Just endless
headlines, day after day.

02:38.680 --> 02:44.079
HUGH: It's chipping away at confidence.
MALCOLM: Absolutely. The thing is...
we're starting to look weak.

02:44.079 --> 02:47.760
MALCOLM: Everybody's saying, "When's
he gonna go. When's he gonna go?"

02:48.840 --> 02:55.760
MALCOLM: Right... And you don't want us
to look weak, do you?
HUGH: No, no...
MALCOLM: So there you are!

02:57.400 --> 03:00.200

HUGH: They're like wolves...

03:17.680 --> 03:22.120
MALCOLM: pissed wolves. I've made the

MALCOLM: Minister...
HUGH: Yeah, get used to "Cliff".

03:27.760 --> 03:33.240
MALCOLM: I've booked you in for
the usual soapy-tit-wank farewell
at Number 10 in 20 minutes.

03:33.240 --> 03:38.600
MALCOLM: I've drafted a letter of
resignation. It says you're jumping
before you're pushed,

03:38.600 --> 03:43.040
MALCOLM: although we are going to be briefing
that you were pushed. Sorry.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.720
HUGH: Um...

03:45.720 --> 03:51.760
HUGH: Look, you don't need to do all this.
What about Tom, yeah? Everybody
knows he's fucking up Transport.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.640
MALCOLM: We can't sack Tom at Transport!
We can't lose anyone at Transport,
they're important!

03:56.640 --> 03:58.480
HUGH: What, and Social Affairs isn't?

03:58.480 --> 04:03.920
MALCOLM: Oh... OK, the Department of
Social Affairs is very important,
but it's not Transport. 

04:03.920 --> 04:06.120
MALCOLM: Transport's cars, buses, trucks...

04:06.120 --> 04:09.080

fucking entails!

HUGH: "Personal reasons"?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.400
MALCOLM: Yeah. I thought that would
give you adequate scope.
HUGH: Scope?

04:24.400 --> 04:28.640
HUGH: What like, um, shooting up in the
Cabinet office or something? What?

04:28.640 --> 04:34.840
HUGH: Stuffing a cat up my arse and having
a wank? What do you mean?
MALCOLM: You know, this could be a great deal worse.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.320
MALCOLM: You have had a good innings.
You have been here for 18 months

04:39.320 --> 04:45.960
MALCOLM: and, you know, I have written
some very nice things about you in
the PM's reply to your resignation.

04:45.960 --> 04:51.640
MALCOLM: Some very nice fucking things
indeed! I had a lump in my throat,
and you know why?

04:51.640 --> 04:58.360
MALCOLM: Because no-one who matters thinks
any the less of you over this...

head that we are going to sack you
because of Press pressure.

HUGH: I wonder why(!)
MALCOLM: Look, you're in no position to dish
out fucking sarcasm, that's over.

MALCOLM: You no longer have purchase in the
sarcasm world! Get on the phone,
tell them that you're jumping

05:21.960 --> 05:28.520
MALCOLM: before you are pushed. We were
going to push you because of your
deeply-held fucking personal issues!

We'll go down, the local yokels
will take photographs

OLLY: Olly, I've got something for us.
I got us a very tasty little morsel,

06:17.800 --> 06:25.000
OLLY: because I had a chat with my very
good friend the Prime Minister of
Great Britain... 
HUGH: Oh, really? Oh?

GLENN: Snooper Squad. Snooper Squad! The
one with spending implications? 
OLLY: Yes.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.560
HUGH: The Prime Minister's view is,
"Fuck the spending implications,
I like it."

06:44.560 --> 06:46.800
GLENN: Good.
HUGH: So this is us, we're on the map.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.480

on Richard And Judy and plant that
flag right on their fucking sofa.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.760
GLENN: So the Prime Minister's
authorised you to announce it?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.960
HUGH: Well, that's very much
what he signalled, yes, very clearly.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.120
HUGH: He said he's right behind us
and it's what we should be doing.

afternoon at the school, can't we?

and... 
TERRI: Excuse me.

We'll leak it to the Standard, then
trail it on The World At One, yes?

that maybe she's a bit junior?

broke your heart then dumped you
with a text message?

a text message. She'll write
what we want. She's easy.

HUGH: No phone calls to the Treasury!

going to have to dress up as
catering with a big tray of drinks

TERRI: I'm not doing that.
HUGH: They'll just take it.

HUGH: Terri, I love doing things
the right way, that ethical stuff,
I love it, we all do,

HUGH: but it's very difficult when you're
the first person to put the gun down,

08:21.440 --> 08:26.720

head as if it's a ripe watermelon.
We don't want that, do we? 
TERRI: OK.

Yeah. Will it be my driver?

I think he despises me.

you know how the pool system works.

OLLY: Something like, Social Affairs
Minister Hugh Abbot

12:08.000 --> 12:13.680
OLLY: will today announce a tough new
crackdown on benefit fraudsters...

12:13.680 --> 12:15.640
OLLY: Um...

12:15.640 --> 12:20.160
OLLY: paragraph. 
ANGELA: Yeah, I can
do the punctuation, Olly. 
OLLY: Sorry.

12:20.160 --> 12:26.960
ANGELA: Actually, I did have it written down
a bit better. 
OLLY: Oh, that's fantastic
Olly. Can I just have that? 
ANGELA: Sure.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.120
OLLY: That's great.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.280
OLLY: It's all... It should all be there.
I've done it in capitals.

12:33.280 --> 12:38.440
ANGELA: Cool? I think I'll say
SENIOR Government sources.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.800
OLLY: Thank you very much!

12:40.800 --> 12:44.280
ANGELA: It sounds better. 
OLLY: Yeah, of course.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.080
GLENN: Olly! Come on! Over here, Olly!

12:51.480 --> 12:53.120
OLLY: Sorry.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.960
GLENN: What's that you've got? 
OLLY: Olives.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.760
GLENN: Olives? Do you want one?
HUGH: He's brought his own olives.

13:01.760 --> 13:08.760
MALCOLM: So the line is, and call every
news desk, that the Snooper Force
story is that it was let out

13:08.760 --> 13:12.600
MALCOLM: by "a disgruntled civil servant".
OK? 

13:12.600 --> 13:16.920
TERRI: OK, great. 
HUGH: Terri... 
TERRI: Mmm?
HUGH: You can drop that tone, all right?

13:16.920 --> 13:20.360
TERRI: What tone? 
HUGH: The
I-knew-better-all-along tone, yeah?

13:20.360 --> 13:23.560
HUGH: It isn't fucking appreciated
right now.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.400
TERRI: Bye.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.000
OLLY: The thing is,
the story isn't a story...

13:28.000 --> 13:31.640
ANGELA: What do you mean? 
OLLY: The Snooper Force.
It's not happening.

13:31.640 --> 13:35.240
OLLY: None of that is actually happ...
None of that is actually happening.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.480
OLLY: I-I can't do this.
ANGELA: You've got to do this.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.920
OLLY: I mean, yeah, you know reading,
talking, I get...I get car sick.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.840
OLLY: I've got to stop. We've got to stop.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.000
OLLY: Jesus Christ!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.880
OLLY: Do you think you could pull in
at the next lay-by?

13:52.640 --> 13:54.800
OLLY: As far as the department
is concerned...

13:54.800 --> 14:00.400
OLLY: As far as the Government
is concerned, there is
no Snooper Force. 
ANGELA: What's going on?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.720
ANGELA: Has the Treasury gone ballistic?
OLLY: No, no.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.800
ANGELA: Is this flip-flop? 
OLLY: No, there's
no flip-flop. Nothing like that...

14:06.800 --> 14:12.080
OLLY: This isn't a change in policy
in any...in any respect. 

14:12.080 --> 14:15.000
ANGELA: No. What's going on, Olly?

14:15.000 --> 14:21.360
OLLY: No, well, the truth is that I...
acted beyond my brief.
ANGELA: What are you talking about?

14:21.360 --> 14:26.680
OLLY: I dunno. I just kind of wanted
to play the big man in front of you.

14:26.680 --> 14:30.240
ANGELA: You came out and you
just made something up? 
OLLY: No, no.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.680
OLLY: I'm really so sorry.
If it's any help...

14:33.680 --> 14:40.280
OLLY: The line that we're getting is that
there's a disgruntled civil servant.
They leaked the story. 
ANGELA: Got a name?

14:40.280 --> 14:46.760
OLLY: Do I have a name for the disgruntled
civil servant? Well, Derek.
Derek Terri...

14:46.760 --> 14:52.880
OLLY: Terri. No, we're gonna pick a name.
We're gonna pick a name. I'm
so sorry. I'm so sorry about this.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.160
ANGELA: This is ridiculous! 
OLLY: No, it's...
ANGELA: Did you plan all of this?

14:56.160 --> 15:02.480
OLLY: The last thing I want to do today
is be stuck in a fucking lay-by,
begging my ex-girlfriend!

15:05.520 --> 15:09.760
HUGH: All right. So what the hell
am I going to say

15:09.760 --> 15:15.400
HUGH: is the reason for me summoning all
the nation's major news organisations
to a school in Wiltshire? 

15:15.400 --> 15:18.200
GLENN: So you want something sexy
and eye-catching and that is free

15:18.200 --> 15:23.960
GLENN: and universally popular
and is instantly applicable, no-one
can possibly object to it? 
HUGH: Yeah.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.960
GLENN: Yes. You should have said something
before, Glenn, because I've got

15:27.960 --> 15:33.400
GLENN: a file that fucking thick of that
back in the office! Those sorts of
policies are ten a penny! 
HUGH: Olly!

15:33.400 --> 15:37.200
GLENN: Our entire manifesto is made up of
them. It doesn't help when you
get cynical. This as an opportunity.

15:37.200 --> 15:43.000
OLLY: It's not that easy to come up with
Das Kapital in the back of the cab,
Glenn! 
HUGH: Olly. Here. Shave.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.640
GLENN: What we need is
something that the public want,
is incredibly popular and is free.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.800
OLLY: Return of capital punishment.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.000
GLENN: That's a joke, right?
You are joking, yes, obviously?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.640
HUGH: Come on, Olly.
Come up with something.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.320
OLLY: National spare room database?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.440
HUGH: Come on, Olly.
Come up with something.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.520
OLLY: What about zoos?

16:08.840 --> 16:11.520
GLENN: My kids went to a zoo the other day

16:11.520 --> 16:14.360
GLENN: and they said it was fucking
disgusting, the state of it. 

16:14.360 --> 16:18.400
HUGH: That's shit, isn't it?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
GLENN: No...

16:22.640 --> 16:27.960
GLENN: But there is an idea there,
because in the middle of the city
you've got wild animals.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.720
OLLY: Pet ASBOs. Remember, ASBOs for pets?

16:29.720 --> 16:35.920
HUGH: That sounds potentially ludicrous,
but then pet passports...
I mean that was a...that was a goer.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.600
GLENN: What if everybody
had to carry a plastic bag.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.960
GLENN: By law. You know the identification
cards are coming in...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.600
HUGH: You've fucking cracked! Are you mad?

16:46.480 --> 16:48.560
GLENN: What if the announcement is...

16:48.560 --> 16:50.440
GLENN: there's no big announcement.

16:50.440 --> 16:57.160
GLENN: Oh... Wait. We say the Department of
Social Affairs has been doing
amazing work, bread-and-butter work,

16:57.160 --> 17:01.000
GLENN: the kind of work that you people
aren't interested in.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.640
GLENN: It's not media-friendly stuff.
You're obsessed with how things play
in the media, you sickos. Sickos!

17:06.640 --> 17:13.319
GLENN: Every time we try and do it, we just
carry on with our day, you don't
show up, so we have to call a big...

17:13.319 --> 17:17.240
HUGH: Why bread and butter? 
GLENN: On target,
under budget... Coal-face politics. 

17:17.240 --> 17:21.720
HUGH: Coal? 
GLENN: Absolutely, yes, I like it. 
HUGH: Not wasting resources. Let's do that.

17:21.720 --> 17:27.359
HUGH: Let's go for that. We trick them
by...a tinselly thing, and they come
along and then we say, "Ah..."

17:27.359 --> 17:33.040
GLENN: That's what we've been doing! We've
been doing our fucking jobs! 
HUGH: Yes,
they never print that stuff, do they?

17:33.040 --> 17:38.720
HUGH: And you've come all this way. We've
got you two hours out of London
to cover this. You mugs! You mugs!

17:38.720 --> 17:42.280
HUGH: You've got a bigger story here
than you have chasing your tinsel.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.960
HUGH: You live in a country which is
properly... There's not
many countries can say that!

17:46.960 --> 17:50.760
GLENN: And we've probably got
ten million we can throw at it. 
HUGH: Yes.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.680
GLENN: That's good, that,
because it sounds like a lot. 
HUGH: Yeah.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.640
GLENN: I've got a thing here that says
"springy concrete".

17:56.640 --> 18:00.560
GLENN: I think that's about the playground
but I don't... 
HUGH: "Springy concrete"?

18:00.560 --> 18:04.480
HUGH: Good afternoon. Should I say, "Hello,
boys and girls"? 
GLENN: Yes, very nice.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.240
HUGH: No, it's going out on TV.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.320
GLENN: It'll look ridiculous if he's on
the six o'clock news
saying, "Hello, boys and girls."

18:11.320 --> 18:14.840
HUGH: ..Real money for real families...
GLENN: He's not patronising them! 

18:14.840 --> 18:17.840
HUGH: Real families or real people?
GLENN: Real people! 
HUGH: Families!

18:17.840 --> 18:24.840
GLENN: You see...families. Families sounds
exclusive. It sounds back to basics.
It sounds John Major, so...

18:24.840 --> 18:30.680
HUGH: "People" sounds communist.
GLENN: It doesn't! 
HUGH: I'll say families.
GLENN: Thank you. 
HUGH: Say "families of people".

18:30.680 --> 18:32.360
UNKNOWN: Mr Abbot...

18:32.360 --> 18:34.560
GLENN: Great, you're on, here we go.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.360
GLENN: It's what you do best, mate. 
HUGH: Yeah.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.920
GLENN: Well, that was a fucking disaster.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.080
HUGH: Well, that... 
GLENN: Shut up.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.320
GLENN: Thank you.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.880
MALCOLM: Ah! Well done.

19:01.880 --> 19:07.320
MALCOLM: There's absolutely nothing
in the Standard. Big fat nothing.
Nothing? You've got away with it.

19:07.320 --> 19:12.680
MALCOLM: He's created a press conference
so boring that none
of the Press will even touch it.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.880
MALCOLM: Fucking well done, mate!
You turned it around. 

19:21.240 --> 19:24.360
GLENN: Well,
you really pulled it round, mate.

19:24.360 --> 19:29.120
HUGH: I took the flack. You supplied the
flack jacket. And the bullets bounced
off.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.880
HUGH: This is what it's all about, Glenn.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.600
HUGH: All those years at the coal-face,
hanging in, taking all the shit.

19:36.600 --> 19:42.440
HUGH: When you're senior Cabinet minister,
then we'll show them. And Snooper
Force... 
GLENN: What? 
HUGH: We'll get rid of that.

19:42.440 --> 19:47.000
GLENN: Oh, for fuck sake, yeah! Fiddling
while Rome burns. 
HUGH: Fucking right!

19:47.000 --> 19:51.800
GLENN: We'll kick some arse, kick some butt!
That's what we're in it for, mate.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.840
GLENN: Instead of all the shit that we do.
HUGH: Have to do. 
GLENN: It's a means to an end!

19:55.840 --> 19:58.440
HUGH: Fuck me, Malcolm! How do you do that?

19:58.440 --> 20:01.000
MALCOLM: Can I have a word with you?

20:03.760 --> 20:06.040
[DOOR SLAMS]

20:06.040 --> 20:10.440
MALCOLM SIGHS DEEPLY
MALCOLM: I'm hacked off, mate.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.440
HUGH: But we...we killed it. It's killed. 

20:13.440 --> 20:18.680
MALCOLM: Yeah. But once you start the fire,
Malc, and we didn't start the fire.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.320
MALCOLM: It's always burning since
the world's been turning, etc, etc.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.240
HUGH: Sorry, Malcolm, you're
not making any sense.

20:26.240 --> 20:32.040
MALCOLM: Prime Minister, obviously he's on
the plane in Stockholm, and somebody
hits him with The World At One.

20:32.040 --> 20:36.480
MALCOLM: He thinks it's the Treasury
trying to stiff him one, so he...

20:42.240 --> 20:44.640
MALCOLM: He stuck with the story.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.480
HUGH: He liked it?

20:46.480 --> 20:49.600
MALCOLM: Yeah, he's backing
the Snooper Force.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.120
HUGH: Oh, right.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.840
HUGH: We shouldn't really then...

20:54.840 --> 20:58.760
HUGH: I mean, you shouldn't
really have told us to...
should you?

20:58.760 --> 21:00.920
MALCOLM: Don't should me, Hugh,

21:00.920 --> 21:03.000
MALCOLM: cos I'll should you right back.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.840
MALCOLM: I'll should you right through
that window.

21:04.840 --> 21:09.400
MALCOLM: None of this
should be happening, should it?
Should it? Should it?

21:09.400 --> 21:13.760
HUGH: Is that "should" in the sense of "yes" or... 

21:13.760 --> 21:18.920
MALCOLM: It's should in the sense that you
should do as you're fucking told.
HUGH: Yeah. What...

21:18.920 --> 21:21.560
HUGH: What are we going to do now?

21:21.560 --> 21:24.840
MALCOLM: You're going to completely
reverse your position.

21:24.840 --> 21:30.040
HUGH: Hang on a second.
Malcolm, it's not actually that...

21:30.040 --> 21:33.440
HUGH: That's going to be quite hard,
really.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.920
MALCOLM: Yes, well, the announcement that
you didn't make today...you did.

21:37.920 --> 21:43.400
HUGH: No, I didn't, and there were
television cameras there
while I was not doing it.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.280
MALCOLM: Fuck them.

21:45.280 --> 21:49.560
HUGH: I'm not sure...what level of reality
I'm supposed to be operating on.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.600
MALCOLM: Look, this is what they run with.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.720
MALCOLM: I tell them that you said it,
they believe that you said it.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.800
MALCOLM: They don't really believe you said
it. They KNOW you never said it...

21:59.800 --> 22:05.200
MALCOLM: Right... But it's in their interest
to say that you said it because
if they don't say that you said it,

22:05.200 --> 22:11.080
MALCOLM: they're not going to get what you
say tomorrow, when I decide to
tell them what it is you're saying.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.400
HUGH: Yeah. I am following this. I just... 

22:13.400 --> 22:17.960
MALCOLM: I had a friend who used to indulge
in extramarital affairs, OK?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.480
MALCOLM: He'd go off
and he'd have some dalliance

22:20.480 --> 22:26.200
MALCOLM: and every Monday, he'd come back
and he'd meet his wife,
and he told me that all he did

22:26.200 --> 22:30.440
MALCOLM: was, inside his head, turn a little
switch - the affair never happened.

22:30.440 --> 22:34.320
MALCOLM: OK? 
HUGH: Right. There's no...
What is the problem with this?

22:34.320 --> 22:39.480
HUGH: The problem with it... First of all,
I didn't get much dalliance.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.920
MALCOLM: Rewind today in your head.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.040
HUGH: OK, stop explaining it to me!

22:44.040 --> 22:48.000
MALCOLM: I have to fucking explain it to you!
You haven't been here long enough.

22:52.360 --> 22:56.680
HUGH: Where are all the people?
Where are my people?

22:56.680 --> 23:00.840
TERRI: Um, they've gone home,
Secretary of State. It's five-forty.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.920
HUGH: OK, well, um, listen...

23:03.920 --> 23:08.440
HUGH: The situation is, um... It's pretty
terrible but things have changed, OK?

23:08.440 --> 23:14.600
HUGH: The line is now I DID announce
the Snooper Force
this afternoon at the school. 

23:14.600 --> 23:17.200
HUGH: OK, that's what happened, all right?

23:17.200 --> 23:24.480
HUGH: So now you have to tell all the media
in case they missed it.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.640
TERRI: OK?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.200
HUGH: Great.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.640
TERRI: I said at the beginning of today
that this would happen!

23:31.640 --> 23:38.360
TERRI: It's happened. It's nobody's fault,
Terri. Now we have to get a list
of everyone... 
HUGH: It's not my fault!

23:38.360 --> 23:40.120
HUGH: I didn't say it was your fault!

23:40.120 --> 23:44.520
TERRI: It is somebody's fault - your fault
and your fault. It's not my fault.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.640
HUGH: If you walk away,
I'll make sure it's pinned on you.
GLENN: Everything going OK?

23:48.640 --> 23:52.160
HUGH: You cunt! We're fucked! 
GLENN: Great(!)

23:52.160 --> 23:55.520
HUGH: This is the real world, Terri.
We're fucked.

23:55.520 --> 24:01.080
GLENN: How's it going? 
HUGH: Good.
I think they might need a little bit
of co-ordination.

24:01.080 --> 24:05.960
HUGH: Who spoke to Nicky Campbell? Has
anyone spoken to Nicky Campbell?

24:05.960 --> 24:08.720
HUGH: I've got one missed call here,
Nicky Campbell.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.320
HUGH: It's become so complicated, and
it's actually terrifically simple. 

24:12.320 --> 24:16.040
HUGH: There was always going to be
a Snooper Force policy. Definitely.

24:16.040 --> 24:19.920
HUGH: It's too good a policy to be invented
by a disgruntled civil servant.

24:19.920 --> 24:25.560
OLLY: I'm really glad you came in.
Angela, you know... 
ANGELA: Well, I could
lose my job, Olly. 
OLLY: Yeah.

24:25.560 --> 24:30.920
ANGELA: I went to the news desk with three
directly contradictory stories
in one day. 
OLLY: I know.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.160
ANGELA: They gave me flip-flops.

24:33.160 --> 24:39.040
ANGELA: You know...someone actually went out
and bought flip-flops to give me.
OLLY: Yeah.

24:39.040 --> 24:45.200
OLLY: You've got to give them credit for
that, though. That is quite funny.
ANGELA: Yeah, and they pasted onto them...

24:45.200 --> 24:49.040
ANGELA: a fucking porn picture of a girl
sucking a big cock,

24:49.040 --> 24:52.280
ANGELA: and they wrote,
"Angela Heaney swallows anything."

24:52.280 --> 24:56.040
OLLY: That is less funny, obviously.
That's actually quite offensive.

24:56.040 --> 25:00.120
ANGELA: Can you give me one good reason why
I shouldn't do a big story on the...

25:00.120 --> 25:03.640
ANGELA: you know...on the day of spin?
OLLY: Why? What sort of story...?

25:03.640 --> 25:09.240
ANGELA: You know, inside story of a
Government department out of control,
with diagrams and a flow chart

25:09.240 --> 25:14.560
ANGELA: with your face and name on it,
Glenn's, Hugh's, and big arrows
showing who spoke to who 

25:14.560 --> 25:19.320
ANGELA: and how you all fucked it up! I think
I could write that one myself, Olly.

25:19.320 --> 25:22.680
ANGELA: I could do the punctuation on it!
OLLY: I'm sorry. I was patronising.

25:22.680 --> 25:27.600
MALCOLM: Hi, Angela. Oh, I like the hair!
..How's it going? 
ANGELA: Yeah, um, fine.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.240
OLLY: We were just, um, talking about

25:31.240 --> 25:38.280
OLLY: why Angela shouldn't do a big story
on the big insider-y piece,

25:38.280 --> 25:43.800
OLLY: kind of day-of-spin sort of spread
in the paper.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.360
MALCOLM: I don't know.
Maybe you should. Good idea.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.160
MALCOLM: Oh, wait a minute!

25:51.160 --> 25:55.400
MALCOLM: I know why she shouldn't!
If she did that she'd be dead...

25:55.400 --> 26:00.800
MALCOLM: to me, to this department,
to the Government, and she'd never
get another story,

26:00.800 --> 26:06.800
MALCOLM: or a fucking whiff of a story,
so long as she kept
her sorry hack bitch face

26:06.800 --> 26:12.200
MALCOLM: lingering around Westminster,
because I would call every editor
I know - that's all of them - 

26:12.200 --> 26:16.360
MALCOLM: and I would tell them to gouge
her name out of their address books

26:16.360 --> 26:22.200
MALCOLM: so she'd never even get a job on
hospital radio - where the sad sack
belongs! That's what I'd tell her.

26:22.200 --> 26:26.520
MALCOLM: But maybe you should do it!
See you later. 
ANGELA: Yeah.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.360
OLLY: He's actually...

26:28.360 --> 26:30.640
OLLY: He can be really nice.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.720
ANGELA: It's been a very long day.

26:32.720 --> 26:39.320
HUGH: I didn't say that we weren't doing
it, which is as good as saying
that we were. Bye. The World Tonight.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.600
HUGH: Hello? Hugh Abbot here...

26:42.760 --> 26:45.560
HUGH: It's always a pleasure
to speak to The World Tonight.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.840
HUGH: Go live on air now?

26:48.960 --> 26:51.640
HUGH: Yes, of course, I'd be delighted to.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.640
HUGH: Robin, my pleasure.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.640
HUGH: Nice to be with you.

26:59.640 --> 27:04.960
HUGH: Yes. Before I answer that question,
may I say how delighted I am,
as we all are in the department,

27:04.960 --> 27:10.640
HUGH: at the excitement and enthusiasm
that our Benefit Fraud
Inspection Unit has created. 

27:10.640 --> 27:16.400
HUGH: I announced at a press conference
this new Benefit Fraud
Inspection Unit,

27:16.400 --> 27:18.840
HUGH: which we are hoping to call...

27:18.840 --> 27:21.160
HUGH: Sponge Avengers,

27:21.160 --> 27:23.800
HUGH: and, um, at that press conference

27:23.800 --> 27:27.440
HUGH: there seems to have been a bit of
a blip

27:27.440 --> 27:31.840
HUGH: because many of the journalists
didn't pick up on the announcement.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.640
HUGH ON RADIO: a bit of scandal or incompetence,
so that statement

27:34.640 --> 27:39.080
HUGH: that the policy was the invention
of a disgruntled civil servant

27:39.080 --> 27:43.120
HUGH: was actually the invention
of a disgruntled civil servant.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.960
HUGH: No, there's only one disgruntled
civil servant, because one of
them's...one of them's an invention

27:46.960 --> 27:53.160
HUGH: by the other one, you see?

27:53.160 --> 27:55.640
HUGH: Anyone listening carefully would have
thought I sounded completely mad.
GLENN: No, you came over loud and clear.

27:55.640 --> 28:01.720
HUGH: It's going to put the whole thing
to bed, anyway. Kill it.

28:01.720 --> 28:05.600
GLENN: And Olly's offered Angela a Private
Life piece about you. 
HUGH: Oh, great(!)

28:05.600 --> 28:09.640
GLENN: A Sunday with you and the family,
go for a walk, spend time with you. 

28:09.640 --> 28:13.680
HUGH: She'll be checking through my books
and snooping in my bathroom cabinet

28:13.680 --> 28:17.720
HUGH: and making snide remarks about how
I don't know who Gail Porter is!
GLENN: We did dick her about, Hugh. 
HUGH: Yeah.

28:17.720 --> 28:23.920
GLENN: And we're getting a roasting
at the moment

28:23.920 --> 28:26.920
GLENN: from what has been dubbed
flip-flop Friday,

28:26.920 --> 28:29.920
GLENN: so we need all the help from friends
we can get right now. 
HUGH: I know.

28:29.920 --> 28:33.600
GLENN: Look, what do you think?

28:33.600 --> 28:36.280
HUGH: Well, I just think that...

28:36.280 --> 28:38.360
HUGH: I want a new driver. I don't
want to see this guy ever again.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.200
GLENN: On what grounds?

28:41.200 --> 28:45.800
HUGH: Smiling. Inappropriate smiling.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.480
HUGH: And smirking. Smiling and smirking.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.160
HUGH: I don't want to see that smile
or smirk ever again. OK?

28:50.160 --> 28:52.560
HUGH: OK, thank you very much. Which way
do you want to go? Blackwall Tunnel?

28:52.560 --> 28:56.440
DRIVER: I don't care, you're the boss.
