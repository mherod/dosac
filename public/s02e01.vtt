WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.720
This programme contains
strong language.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.840
Terri, is...? Oh, hello, Robyn.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.080
Where's Terri? Is she not...?

00:06.840 --> 00:11.080
Oh! Morning, Mr Lover-Lover-Man.

00:11.080 --> 00:15.240
Does... Does nobody else
ever shag anybody else
in Westminster? Is that...

00:15.240 --> 00:17.680
Hey! Horatio!

00:17.680 --> 00:18.880
How's it hanging?

00:18.880 --> 00:20.640
It's hanging just fine, thanks.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.680
Sleeping with the opposition,
I hear. Not all of them.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.920
What do they do? Do they keep
a tight hold on the fiscal...?

00:26.920 --> 00:29.800
Scrotum? What? What?

00:29.800 --> 00:33.080
Shagging the opposition! Never
would have happened in my day.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.840
She's not my opposite number, cos
Levitt has gone to shadow defence,

00:36.840 --> 00:40.560
so she's doing shadow defence,
so she's no longer social affairs...

00:40.560 --> 00:44.040
Did you manage to do some good
and steal a few policy papers?

00:44.040 --> 00:48.960
It's hard to know why you're so
unsuccessful with the opposite sex.
I tell you what...

00:48.960 --> 00:53.480
Where the fuck's Terri! Oh, Terri?
Did you not know? Malcolm's...

00:53.480 --> 00:55.840
Malcolm's what? Binned her.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.720
She's gone. You're jo... Morning.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.400
Morning, stud.
Enjoy your walk on the wild side?

01:00.400 --> 01:06.960
How was your dip in the wild blue?
How do you know? You're the most

01:00.400 --> 01:06.960
uninformed... Everyone knows, Ollie.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.640
My milkman knows. Hugh, I have
some wonderful news for you.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.240
Terri's gone. What?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.000
Terri. Terri's gone.
What do you mean, "gone"?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.560
Yeah. A resignation bluff
that went awry.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.200
No? Yeah. Yes!

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
Oh, result!

01:21.200 --> 01:24.520
Woo-woo! All right! Come on!

01:24.520 --> 01:28.320
High five. Good morning, Secretary
of State, just to let you know...

01:28.320 --> 01:30.280
Terri's father's had a stroke. What?

01:30.280 --> 01:33.440
It's pretty serious, so she's going
to be gone quite a while.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.479
Oh, dear. That's awful.
I'm so sorry.

01:36.479 --> 01:40.120
I'm sorry. I was just shitting you.
It was just an early-morning joke.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.680
I was that close to buying
the champagne and Ritz crackers.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.520
Sorry, it was just a stupid...
He made a joke.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.479
Should I send her a card?

01:49.479 --> 01:54.280
Yeah, of course. That would
be completely appropriate.
Do you want to give me £8?

01:54.280 --> 01:57.200
Yeah, erm... I was kidding!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.880
It was a joke.

01:58.880 --> 02:02.160
It was a joke... OK.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.840
OK.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.360
It's Robyn. Robyn Murdoch, isn't it?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
That's Robyn Murdoch? Yeah, yeah.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.640
I always thought Robyn Murdoch
was a bloke. No, no.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.360
I thought THAT...
was Robyn Murdoch's secretary.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.360
I always thought that was someone
whose name I didn't know.
No, that's Robyn.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.000
Oh. Turns out I didn't
know her name after all,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.280
but I had it attached
to someone unknown's face.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.079
She'll be much easier to cut out
of the loop with the factory visit.

02:29.079 --> 02:33.920
Can we send out a revised biography
and not that photograph
of me with the fucking moustache?

02:33.920 --> 02:37.520
I look like a disgraced geography
teacher. I can't help you with that.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.360
Why not? I've been seconded.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.360
I'm off for the week.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.280
We beg to fucking differ. Where do
you think you're going? Number 10.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.960
I've been talent-spotted.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.800
He said I was over there for the week

02:45.960 --> 02:48.800
if it's OK with you,

02:48.800 --> 02:50.160
which he said it would be.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.880
Oh, well, obviously it is then.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.360
Oh. They'll only want him
to make cappuccinos.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.760
Well, he does it very well.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.640
I think it's the way you waggle
your finger in the milk.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.720
Yeah, you think it's my finger,
bitch.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.880
Where's Neil?
Leicester, poor fucker.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.400
You'd think when you achieve
a certain status,

03:05.400 --> 03:07.440
you'd be excused visiting Leicester.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.680
Have you seen the whip's numbers?
NOMFuP. Eh? NOMFuP.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.720
N-O-M-F-P. Not my fucking problem.
I like that. Do you?

03:13.720 --> 03:16.760
I think I'll use that quite a lot
today. I'll use it as well.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.720
Ho! Well done with fatty's profile.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.320
I nearly liked
the enormous fucker reading it.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.600
Any time.
What if the MoD breaks tonight?

03:23.600 --> 03:27.360
What I'm hearing is the overspend's
getting more brutal by the hour.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.200
They're talking about topping off
at 1, 1½ billion.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.160
Obviously, that's a lot of nurses.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.120
Or one fantastically enormous
robotic one, yeah? Obviously.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.720
And how's the minister?
He's shitting himself.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.600
He's practically
kissing his driver goodbye.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.320
He said he felt like he was
in the Twin Towers on 9/11, you know,

03:46.320 --> 03:47.720
"Just fucking waiting."

03:47.720 --> 03:50.640
For fuck's sake. But everybody
knows the lines, yeah?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.920
IT projects always overspend.
Oh, yeah.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.520
Could you manage to get me a decent
cup of tea? Would that be possible?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.960
Thank you. Try not to drip in it.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.480
I tell you the thing
that's worrying me. Is this dodgy?

04:02.480 --> 04:05.680
I don't know. The kid's firm
was the second lowest bid.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.560
He says they never talked.
What does it matter?

04:08.560 --> 04:11.240
No, but you know me.
I'm a man of principle.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.000
I like to know if I'm lying
to save a tosser or a moron.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.000
Probably a moron.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.680
Is this yours? Is this new?

04:16.680 --> 04:20.800
Yeah, I thought I'd get it for

04:16.680 --> 04:20.800
Number 10. Has it got a camera on it?

04:20.800 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, it's on the back.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.000
Happy slap him. Go on.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.760
How do you know about happy slapping?
How do YOU begin to know about...?

04:27.760 --> 04:29.200
Get off! I missed it.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.960
Do it again. That's assault.
Get off!

04:31.960 --> 04:37.120
No, listen. It's all right because
we can doctor the crime figures.

04:31.960 --> 04:37.120
I really like this.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.600
I'll punch you in your substantial

04:37.120 --> 04:40.600
gut! Fucking hell, Robyn!

04:40.600 --> 04:42.720
You little fucker. I got it, look.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.640
THEY LAUGH

04:44.640 --> 04:48.920
It's very good. We should take
one of us so he's got something

04:44.640 --> 04:48.920
to remember us by...

04:48.920 --> 04:53.240
SHUTTER CLICKS

04:48.920 --> 04:53.240
..because at the end of the week,
you'll be head of the policy unit.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.000
Giving head to the policy unit.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.720
Hugh, can we do the prep
for the factory visit now?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.240
We're gonna get there
at about 12, 12.30, OK?

05:01.240 --> 05:03.080
I forgot the...

05:05.560 --> 05:08.560
Stupid boy. That WAS funny.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.120
That was funny? Yeah.
I don't think it was funny.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.200
I'm an elected representative
of the people. It was funny.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.800
SAM! >

05:15.800 --> 05:19.160
Sam, a coffee and a fucking skinny
muffin if that's possible.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.000
hat the fuck are YOU doing HERE?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I thought you said today, Malcolm.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.640
Did you not say... I mean what are

05:23.000 --> 05:26.640
you doing there? Come on. Sorry.

05:26.640 --> 05:31.360
I didn't want to interrupt you.

05:26.640 --> 05:31.360
If the PM's giving me a blowjob,

05:26.640 --> 05:31.360
I always put a sign up.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.760
Right. You're the kind of guy

05:31.360 --> 05:34.760
we need in here, you really are.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.280
Terrific. You are

05:34.760 --> 05:38.280
the proverbial bright spark, eh?

05:38.280 --> 05:40.760
Thanks, Malcolm. Horace! Right. OK.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.400
Horace? What's all that stuff
you've got there?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.280
This is all my social policy pitches

05:45.280 --> 05:48.200
and some funding structures
I worked on for my PhD...

05:48.200 --> 05:51.280
Is that right that you shagged
that shadow defence bird?

05:51.280 --> 05:53.200
Not exactly. It's complicated.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.040
Hey, Jamie. This is Ollie.
What, THE Ollie?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.440
The "Stuck one
up the opposition" Ollie?

05:58.440 --> 06:00.560
Good fucking man!
Good to meet you.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.320
This is Jamie. He'll be looking
after you. Oh, great.

06:03.320 --> 06:08.840
Another Scot, I see. Does everyone
have to be in the "Caledonian Mafia"
to... Hey, everybody! This is Ollie.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.320
He's the guy that fucked
the opposition for us.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.280
That was...quite an introduction.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.880
Would you just nod
when the big fucker talks,

06:15.880 --> 06:17.280
but DO whatever I say, OK?

06:17.280 --> 06:19.200
Actually, it's the other way around.

06:19.200 --> 06:24.320
Right, Jamie's going to put you in
touch with Paul. Paul vets all the
stuff that we put into the attack.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.040
Technically, you shouldn't be doing
this from in here, but the
mainframe's not here, right?

06:29.040 --> 06:33.120
So, technically, you're not! Sorry,
stuff about Emma? About Emma, yeah.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.800
Oh. Hey, Ollie.
I know that you're dead brainy,

06:36.800 --> 06:40.159
but look, I've got brains
coming out of my fucking arse.

06:40.159 --> 06:43.640
What I need
is political intelligence.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.000
I just feel awkward,
you know, about...

06:46.000 --> 06:48.360
Oh, it's make your mind up time,
Ollie!

06:48.360 --> 06:50.280
What do you want to be? Come on!

06:50.280 --> 06:54.960
Do you want to be a prick that works
here for a year then goes away
to join a think tank to write,

06:54.960 --> 06:57.480
"On one hand, this,
but on the other hand, that,"

06:57.480 --> 07:01.320
or do you want to be a soldier?
Have you got your eyes on the prize?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.320
I've got my eyes on the prize. Good.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.840
Yeah, but what is the prize?

07:05.840 --> 07:07.320
I dunno. Ask the brain guys,

07:07.320 --> 07:09.960
but I'll settle
for just keeping us in government

07:09.960 --> 07:12.200
instead of the wankers
you're shagging!

07:12.200 --> 07:16.840
This roll in the hay, have you got
something there that'll keep us
working for a morning,

07:16.840 --> 07:18.680
or is this an ongoing scenario?

07:18.680 --> 07:22.640
I think I've got one pretty
satisfied customer there, you know?

07:22.640 --> 07:27.760
Do you know about what's kicking off
in Defence? Geoff Holhurst

07:22.640 --> 07:27.760
and his son, Christian - Iltech.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.120
Yeah. 80, 90% of it, I would say.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.520
Shall I drag Holhurst in,

07:31.520 --> 07:34.720
see if there's anything else mouldy
in the cupboard? Yeah.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.080
Ollie, see anything
in Defence, son,

07:37.080 --> 07:40.520
anything that just gives us another
angle... I mean, just ask her.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.080
Just look around her house,
find something.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.840
OK. See you, have a good day.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.840
Yes. See you, Malcolm.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.640
You can have this desk, it's free.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.720
Don't worry,
she won't be coming back.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.280
Just give me a shout
if you need anything, OK?

07:52.280 --> 07:56.920
Yep. Listen, don't touch the

07:52.280 --> 07:56.920
keyboard. Bob'll go fucking nuts.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.320
Just use your laptop
if you've got one, aye?

07:59.320 --> 08:03.640
So, I've been given
a desk in Number 10...

08:03.640 --> 08:05.880
to ring my girlfriend?

08:05.880 --> 08:07.920
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.240
Shagging your way to the top,
then, is it?

08:10.240 --> 08:14.120
Yes, well I'm not Scottish, so I've
got to get here somehow, haven't I?

08:14.120 --> 08:18.200
I've confirmed that there'll be
a regional news team
filming our arrival,

08:18.200 --> 08:21.800
plus four local papers.
Regional news? No nationals?

08:21.800 --> 08:26.520
This is very much a regional event.
I didn't think that... Look, Robyn.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.640
All events are regional.

08:29.640 --> 08:35.960
Everything that happens in the world
has to happen somewhere, do you see?

08:35.960 --> 08:41.640
Even JFK's assassination
was a regional event,

08:41.640 --> 08:44.680
but it was also very important, hmm?

08:44.680 --> 08:48.560
We... Like this factory visit. Yes.
Do you see that?

08:48.560 --> 08:51.360
No national papers?

08:51.360 --> 08:53.400
No national...

08:53.400 --> 08:54.960
Right.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.360
Not one national paper?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.120
No? No.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.440
How is that possible?

09:06.440 --> 09:09.720
How long are we supposed
to hang around here?

09:09.720 --> 09:13.240
I promised. 20 minutes.
We're scheduled for two hours.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.360
Yeah...

09:15.360 --> 09:17.760
Who's going to do the...thing?
What thing?

09:17.760 --> 09:23.000
We do a thing with Terri where
I give her a signal...you know?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.520
And she makes up some sort of excuse
about having to go...

09:26.520 --> 09:30.840
A change of arrangements... Yeah.
..then we've got to go.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.880
Yeah, cabinet emergencies.
You know about that, do you?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.560
Yep, yep.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.080
Absolutely.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.800
I do!

09:40.800 --> 09:42.680
Hi. Hi, Emma.

09:42.680 --> 09:47.840
I just wanted to know... Can I
just borrow your seat here?
Thanks, Jamie.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.360
I really like you, and...

09:50.360 --> 09:51.920
HE PRETENDS TO VOMIT ↑

09:51.920 --> 09:56.200
..and if something feels right,
you know... Hi, Geoff.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.480
Here he is. Here's the man himself.
How are you?

09:59.480 --> 10:03.800
What, they've been after you for
stuff about me? Your fucking whips?

10:03.800 --> 10:07.520
Have these people... I think...
No decency.

10:07.520 --> 10:12.480
Speaking of which, have you heard any
of this MoD stuff that's going about?

10:12.480 --> 10:16.800
How much fucking shit
is there on the menu,

10:12.480 --> 10:16.800
and what fucking flavour is it?!

10:16.800 --> 10:22.520
Malcolm? No, no. I'm in a Scottish
restaurant and some man's complaining
cos they've under-fried his Mars bar.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.240
Of course it's Malcolm.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.320
Well, Malcolm's always animated.
That's him every day.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.280
It's like this furnace of shit.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.760
It's not good for my system. His firm

10:30.280 --> 10:34.760
put in the second lowest tender.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.680
Do you fancy meeting up?
Maybe tomorrow night?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.480
You're worse than dead meat.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.400
You're too toxic
to even feed to the vultures.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.160
I asked you out last night because I
really...like you, and...

10:50.080 --> 10:53.960
Yeah. OK, bye.
If I've got to go, I've got to go.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.800
Well, here we are, Hugh.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.080
Christ.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.960
There we go.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.160
Hello. Thank you very much.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.440
Nice to meet you.
Are these employees?

11:06.440 --> 11:08.080
May I say hello?

11:08.080 --> 11:10.760
Hello. Hugh Abbot.
Nice to meet you.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.160
Nice to meet you.
Hello. Lovely to meet you.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.280
Do you know what it's like to clean
up your own mother's piss?

11:16.280 --> 11:20.920
I'm sorry. Do you? I mean,
she was in that home for 16 weeks.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.760
Do you know what it's like to clean
up your own mother's piss?

11:24.760 --> 11:26.800
That's very tough, isn't it?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.560
That's very, very tough,

11:28.560 --> 11:31.840
and our hearts - all our hearts -
go out to you.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.680
But do you know what it's like

11:33.680 --> 11:36.760
to get down and clean up
your own mother's piss?

11:36.760 --> 11:41.280
I think that I'm probably not the
right person to talk to about this.

11:36.760 --> 11:41.280
Who do I talk to?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.920
Urinary and affairs like that
are probably more...help.

11:44.920 --> 11:49.120
So, if anyway... Lovely to talk
to you. What fantastic landscaping.

11:49.120 --> 11:55.200
I really do think it makes an
enormous difference to the workplace
when you have this relationship...

11:55.200 --> 11:58.080
But is that your answer?
Is that your answer?

11:58.080 --> 12:02.040
We'll get someone to note your
case, and do what we can about it.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.160
You'll get someone to note my case?
Nobody's noted my case so far.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.640
Stop it! Don't touch me!
What are you touching me for?!

12:09.640 --> 12:12.880
You don't know me! You don't even
want to know me, do you?

12:12.880 --> 12:15.320
I do... I would like
to get to know you,

12:15.320 --> 12:19.520
but I just... Why are you walking

12:15.320 --> 12:19.520
away from me?! Would you like to know
the facts?

12:19.520 --> 12:21.240
The minister would love to know.

12:21.240 --> 12:26.200
There are two qualified nurses.
Out of all those care assistants,
only two of 'em. Just smile.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.440
What you smiling at? What you
grinning at? Do you think it's funny?
Do you think I'm funny?!

12:31.440 --> 12:33.720
Do you think
my mother's piss is funny?!

12:33.720 --> 12:35.160
Well, it's not funny!

12:35.160 --> 12:38.280
She's not laughing!
She's pissing herself.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.560
I'm not laughing. I'm crying.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.320
Glenn, is she still saying it?

12:43.320 --> 12:46.480
Oh, God, yes. ..Would you please

12:43.320 --> 12:46.480
give me a moment.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.680
Yes, she's banging on
about it even now.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.760
The trouble is they reckon they've
got some great shots. Great shots?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.280
The thing is, don't panic.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.240
Is it what you do, though,
because it's disgusting!

12:57.240 --> 12:59.680
You cannot treat people like this.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.960
Can you please shut up for one
fucking minute?!

13:02.960 --> 13:06.800
I'm asking nicely. Please.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.280
Now, Hugh.
I'm going to have to hang up.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.040
Did you enjoy that?
Did you enjoy that?

13:12.040 --> 13:15.080
I apologise.
I am giving you a number.

13:15.080 --> 13:19.280
Your dad told us that he didn't know
you worked for the company.
You never told him.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.560
Ollie Reeder.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.960
< What we're finding difficult

13:20.560 --> 13:22.960
to work out...

13:22.960 --> 13:24.920
Erm... Sorry, who is this?

13:24.920 --> 13:26.720
Well, obviously he knew, but...

13:26.720 --> 13:29.520
No, I've never cleaned up
my own mother's piss.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.920
Erm, sorry. Who are you?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.840
Well, you do talk to your dad.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.160
Yeah. Well, how did you get...
No, you fucking don't!

13:37.160 --> 13:40.000
Stop going on about...
That is the wrong answer!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.640
The wrong fucking answer!

13:42.640 --> 13:45.000
Don't be aggressive.
I will call you back.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.360
You tell your corporate affairs
people,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.200
otherwise I'll come along there

13:49.200 --> 13:52.200
and fucking maim every single
fucking one of them, OK?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.680
Good to see you. Yeah... All right?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.960
Well done, Christian.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.560
He's one of these
fucking Popsbridge types.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.320
Won't play dumb.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.560
I think he can dumb up for us.
Malcolm. What?

14:04.560 --> 14:06.880
It's Hugh... What is it?!

14:06.880 --> 14:09.120
I dunno. A woman hit him
with a question.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.160
It's got a bit aggressive, and it's
gonna look bad on the news. NOMFuP.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.480
Wait, wait. Dig some stuff
up on the woman, OK? OK.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.120
I'm on my way over to ITN right now.
I'm going to sweet-talk Pam Morris,

14:21.120 --> 14:26.240
but I could easily just pop in and
talk to... I could fucking kick the

14:21.120 --> 14:26.240
shit out of Mark Davies. Yeah.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.360
That's what I'll do.
That's a good idea.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.760
I could actually do that. It'd
be therapeutic, a bit of shouting.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.360
A bit of fucking yin and yang.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.680
OK. Quite spiritual. Yeah.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.680
Get somebody in there, all right?
See you later.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.960
Mate, how's it going with the
missus?

14:39.960 --> 14:43.960
What have you got for me on the
opposition angle? Erm... Which one?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.560
What the fuck do you think?

14:45.560 --> 14:49.280
Fucking Tweenies tour-dates(!)
The MoD IT overspend.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.840
Well, erm, I'm tickling a few trout,
you know?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.240
You're tickling trout?

14:55.240 --> 14:57.560
Mmm-hmm. You know, tickling...

14:57.560 --> 14:58.800
Just seeing if I can...

15:01.240 --> 15:02.400
What does that mean?

15:03.160 --> 15:07.840
We're going to go for a drink
tomorrow night. That's no good,
the vote's tonight!

15:07.840 --> 15:11.600
Call her now and rearrange. What if
she's busy? Whoa-whoa! NOMFuP.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.200
Just tickle the old trout
and make it happen.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.400
Hi, Emma. I've messed up.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.120
Tomorrow night,
I'm actually not free.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.840
I've got a squash game
with Dan Miller.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.120
Er... No, obviously, you're more
important than a squash game.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.480
Could we rearrange
tomorrow for tonight?

15:33.480 --> 15:34.680
Film, fine.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.920
I have seen the original Solaris. I'd
love to see it again. It's a classic.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.240
It is a classic.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.560
All right. I'll see you later...babe.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.440
All right. Yep. Bye.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.480
Thanks, funny bunny.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.080
Right, I've got a job for you.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.160
This is brilliant.
I love these pipes. Er, Hugh.

15:55.160 --> 15:59.120
Excuse me for just a second. Sorry.
Ollie. I've got him for you.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.080
Thank you. Can he stop it?

16:02.080 --> 16:05.600
I managed to persuade him
to go over and have a word at ITN.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.800
Well done, Ollie,
my man on the inside!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.840
How does he do that? It's so spooky.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.560
He's like voodoo.
He's like a bad Gandalf.

16:13.560 --> 16:18.400
There's something else big that might
be breaking. What's breaking?

16:18.400 --> 16:21.680
Geoff Holhurst is up to his neck in
shit over his son's IT firm

16:21.680 --> 16:25.120
getting the tender for a system
that's gone two billion over.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.640
They're bricking themselves that
it'll leak. Bad day for Geoff, eh?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.960
Very bad day for Geoff.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.960
I'm bumped off the news.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.400
Right. And this at least means...

16:35.400 --> 16:38.320
Glenn, Glenn.
Geoff's up to his tits.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.400
..this is essentially good news
for me, right?

16:41.400 --> 16:44.160
You would certainly have thought
so, yeah.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.680
Glenn, talk to Ollie.
Congratulate him.

16:46.680 --> 16:50.320
Oh, right. ..What a great place this
is. I love this bloody factory.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.120
Hiya, Glenn. Before you go on,

16:52.120 --> 16:55.040
can I just say thanks very much for
the piss woman?

16:55.040 --> 16:57.800
She was brilliant, she was.
Yeah, more of those.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.160
Don't tell me any more because I
won't be able to take it in,

17:01.160 --> 17:03.440
but I will pass on
what you said to the PM,

17:03.440 --> 17:05.319
cos he absolutely loves detail.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.920
Right, so, Robyn...

17:08.079 --> 17:09.560
Erm, Secretary of State,

17:09.560 --> 17:12.040
I'm sorry, but there's been
a change of plans

17:12.040 --> 17:15.480
and we're actually going to have
to go in the next few minutes.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.760
I'm terribly sorry.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.119
No! We're definitely going to have
to go.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.240
Oh, no. That's very disappointing.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.640
It's...the cabinet. We...
I'm so sorry.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.119
Why do we have to go? Erm...

17:27.119 --> 17:28.640
Important, is it?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.480
Yeah? It is quite important.
That's a shame.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.320
I was hoping we could stay and have
lunch. Of course.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.040
I was looking forward to that.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.160
Well, we can... No, we can.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.120
We can stay for lunch,
if you'd like to. What? I just...

17:42.120 --> 17:44.640
I thought you were doing the thing.
We can stay.

17:44.640 --> 17:49.120
We can definitely stay for lunch.
I thought you said it was important.

17:44.640 --> 17:49.120
No, no, no.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.240
No. It's really fine, honestly.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.160
I can make any phone calls that we
need to from here.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.840
Great, OK.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.480
Great. We've only been here 20
minutes,

17:58.480 --> 18:01.520
so it would be a shame to go now.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.560
Mark? Hi. Mark Davies?

18:05.560 --> 18:07.640
We've spoken on the phone.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.040
Do you mind if I pop in?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.200
I was in seeing Pam

18:10.200 --> 18:13.840
and everyone's been talking about
the Hugh thing. Yes.

18:13.840 --> 18:17.920
'Do you know what it's like
to clean up your own mother's piss?'

18:17.920 --> 18:19.880
Jesus! Look at his face!

18:19.880 --> 18:22.360
Do you see what I have to work with?
I know.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.120
He doesn't look great, does he?

18:24.120 --> 18:25.400
'Who DO I talk to?'

18:26.840 --> 18:30.800
Are you going to use that? Malcolm.
Sorry. Don't touch that.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.440
This isn't the package, is it? Mark?

18:33.440 --> 18:36.360
'That's just blah, blah, blah...'
You can't use that.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.280
This is dumbing down of the news

18:38.280 --> 18:41.760
that people like me and
your boss's boss really object to,

18:41.760 --> 18:43.720
and I'm going to mention this to him

18:43.720 --> 18:45.720
when I see him on Friday,
by the way.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.320
Malcolm, this is a traditional,
old-fashioned news story,

18:49.320 --> 18:51.280
called "Minister looks a tit."

18:51.280 --> 18:54.400
Hey, everybody looks a tit,
you know?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.560
Take two of these shots of him
looking moronic out.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.360
Leave a couple in of him looking a
little bit dim.

19:00.360 --> 19:04.720
Put one of him composed,
drop it down the running order,
and we've got a deal.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.800
I'm not... "Deal," what do you mean?

19:06.800 --> 19:09.440
He looks a tit, that's it. I'm sorry.

19:09.440 --> 19:14.440
But there is a difference between
allowing someone's natural
tittishness to come through,

19:14.440 --> 19:17.360
and just exploiting it through
camerawork here.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.000
You're sticking one tit moment
on top of another.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.680
That wouldn't happen in real life.
And do you know about that woman?

19:23.680 --> 19:27.240
Have you made ANY enquiries
into her background?

19:27.240 --> 19:32.320
I'm sure my researchers have, yes.
Your researchers have?
Well, I don't think they have.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.200
Excuse me a second.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.120
Malcolm.
Have you got anything on the woman?

19:37.120 --> 19:40.560
I've got Frankie up there now
rooting through the bins. Hang on.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.640
..Have you got anything?

19:42.640 --> 19:46.080
Nothing. Bloody chips, bin stuff.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.800
'Nothing, Malcolm.'

19:47.800 --> 19:49.280
Bin stuff.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.880
BNP, Mark.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.760
She's standing for the British
National Party. Stamford Bridge.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.520
For fuck's sake!

20:02.520 --> 20:06.960
Very straightforward. Basic stuff,
Mark. Do your research.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.720
Standing
for the British National Party.

20:09.720 --> 20:14.560
All right. What do you want, Mark?
Two little bits of tit. Two titties.

Sunita has spilled the overspend.

No.

she went and gave the driver

they think people like me think,

22:09.000 --> 22:14.240
so I hate thinking it,

22:14.240 --> 22:16.280

"They're from

You know, T-shirts,

Why do they wear clothes with

the fucking fax from the Standard?

Not exactly, Hugh.

Wait. This other story, he's not
going to stitch me up, is he?

Everything is...incredibly busy

22:54.880 --> 22:58.080
I just need you to keep me out of
the firing line, Ollie.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.960
It's slightly difficult,

22:59.960 --> 23:04.840
cos I'm only one pawn in this, and
a pawn can't take a queen, can it?

23:04.840 --> 23:06.000
Yes, it can.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Technically, yes, of course it can,
but, you know...

23:09.000 --> 23:11.360
A queen is a lot bigger than a pawn,
isn't it?

23:11.360 --> 23:15.680
I know, but if you get a pawn
over to the other side
of the board, Ollie,

23:15.680 --> 23:19.160
it can become a queen, or a bishop,
or a senior advisor.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.640
You hear what I'm saying?

23:20.640 --> 23:23.120
Yes, yes. I understand.

it was a difficult position,

OK.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.720
news values of your corporation
are seriously skewed,

25:05.720 --> 25:10.400
