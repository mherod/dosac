WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:08.119
This programme contains very strong
language and adult humour

00:08.119 --> 00:11.920
Nowadays, I think twat and prat
are pretty interchangeable.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.640
Anyway, semantic society shouldn't
be saying anything like that to you

00:16.640 --> 00:19.080
and I take your point, Mum.
I will have a word.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.760
The opposition have to
let senior civil servants

00:21.760 --> 00:25.400
and people like me know exactly
what they're hoping to achieve,

00:25.400 --> 00:30.080
so that when they're handed
the reins of power... Um...

00:30.080 --> 00:34.000
Well, I think they are going to be.
This lot are looking quite toasted.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.600
Right. Emma has thrown a massive
hissy-fit again at my Mum.

00:39.600 --> 00:44.080
Like you care! I need you to do a
bit of proper parenting for once.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.320
Can you give me a call?

00:45.320 --> 00:48.640
If you don't, I will
have you thrown in Belmarsh.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.200
We've been trying to find out where
Ollie is. As usual, he's not in yet.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.440
OK. Meeting room.
Ollie, good afternoon.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.160
I haven't missed it, have I? Ollie,
have you seen my strategy file?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.680
I don't know, Terri.
What's happened to Terri?

01:00.680 --> 01:02.720
She looks like
a female impersonator!

01:02.720 --> 01:05.040
Looks like she's come
from a gay undertaker's.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.600
Phil, I'm trying to prep
for Implementation Day,

01:09.600 --> 01:12.960
and you're just cutting out
more weird Japanese cartoons.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.360
It's for the matrix!
When we infiltrate DoSAC,
I want to prioritise targets.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.440
Look, Terri Coverley.
Head of Press, Civil Service.
And who exactly is that?

01:21.440 --> 01:25.840
Well, it's Ahura,
but she's head of comms on
the Enterprise, so it makes sense!

01:25.840 --> 01:29.080
I wonder if we'll sneak up

01:25.840 --> 01:29.080
on Ollie and catch him not working!

01:29.080 --> 01:32.400
Better still, I'd like to see
him getting bollocked by Malcolm!

01:32.400 --> 01:35.920
I'm going to rip out your bladder
and wear it as a bandana!

01:35.920 --> 01:38.160
I need to know
what Glen Cullen looks like.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.360
Oh, Glen Cullen. Er, '50s,
kind of depressed-looking.
I always think of a bloodhound.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.479
OK, I'll get a picture
of Mick Hucknell.

01:45.479 --> 01:48.120
Morning, comrades!
How goes the revolution?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.880
Morning! Morning, Peter.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.240
Our tanks on their lawn, at last!

01:52.240 --> 01:53.960
Fuck-a-doodle-do!

01:53.960 --> 01:58.320
Talking of which, may I present
the DoSAC implementation matrix!
Don't ask!

01:58.320 --> 02:03.120
Look, this is a very
straightforward set of meetings
with the senior civil servants.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.760
"Where's the stopcock? Where can
I get a decent cup of coffee?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.320
"Here's our agenda
for the next three years."

02:09.320 --> 02:13.640
Yeah, but Stuart's very keen
for us to use the visit to DoSAC
as a scouting exercise.

02:13.640 --> 02:17.000
I'm keen to use Stuart's mouth as
an ashtray. Doesn't mean I'd do it!

02:17.000 --> 02:19.600
Social mobility.
What does that actually mean?

02:19.600 --> 02:24.880
Well, it's just a personal
observation, but every time I
hear the words "social mobility"

02:24.880 --> 02:28.160
I keep thinking

02:24.880 --> 02:28.160
about one of those shopping trolleys

02:28.160 --> 02:30.800
that go down the pavement,
the electric things...

02:30.800 --> 02:34.360
What does it mean to normal people?
It means really

02:34.360 --> 02:40.640
lifting people out of a world
of disadvantage and into
a world of opportunity.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.720
Sorry, just one sec, I've just
got to switch that to voicemail.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.680
OK, fourth sector, mean anything?

02:49.480 --> 02:52.160
Nothing? Great!
Because we're about to create it.

02:52.160 --> 02:57.160
The fourth sector is, basically,
real people, ordinary people...

02:57.160 --> 02:59.440
just give me one sec.
Hello, Nicola Murray.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.800
What's going on at
the school, anyway?

03:01.800 --> 03:05.760
Things are a bit shitty at home and
the daughter's gone all Raging Bull.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.840
Has she put on a lot of weight?

03:07.840 --> 03:12.560
No, no, I mean she's kicking off
at school, basically ever since

03:12.560 --> 03:15.960
Malcolm made Nicola put her

03:12.560 --> 03:15.960
in the fucking comp. Headed for what

03:15.960 --> 03:20.320
Mr Neil Diamond, would have called
a Sweet Columbine incident.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.600
Oh, I don't give two shits of a
lamb's tail. Eileen will have to
postpone her fuckin' throat surgery.

03:25.600 --> 03:32.480
I want her steam-cleaned and on the
Daily Politics, smiling and nodding
at Andrew Neil's sneery fucking

03:32.480 --> 03:36.440
haemorrhoid face and tell him
to lay off the fucking
fish suppers and poppers.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.640
Hi, there.
Where's Dame Ellen McArse-ache?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.280
She's on her...

03:42.280 --> 03:45.079
All right, OK, wakey, wakey, wakey!
Yes, yes!

03:45.079 --> 03:49.280
Opposition drill, yeah, come on!
Tell James he will go to school

03:49.280 --> 03:55.120
and if he doesn't, then he will find
himself sleeping in the spare room
of his fucking sister's house!

03:55.120 --> 03:59.160
Lovely, thank you.
Yeah, opposition drill, right? Yeah.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.400
When the opposition are here,
tell them nothing, except where

04:02.400 --> 04:05.160
the toilets are, but lie.
Terri, keep your tits in!

04:06.520 --> 04:08.880
Very 'air-hostess' today!
For Mannion?

04:08.880 --> 04:11.240
All I said was that
I think he's charming.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.280
Should we be formally dressed
for DoSAC?

04:14.280 --> 04:17.640
It does feel a bit like paying our
respects to some mad dying aunt!

04:17.640 --> 04:21.000
No, you look fine. It's all pretty
shambolic there at the moment.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.520
Nicola Murray is distracted
with the daughter.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.400
Oh, what's that? Really interesting?

04:27.400 --> 04:31.120
No! Private. That's Stuart.
I'm just gonna have to show him up.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.720
Great. Mr Blue Sky. We're not gonna
practice fist bumps again, are we?

04:34.720 --> 04:38.280
Phil, if you mention anything
out of turn while I'm gone,

04:38.280 --> 04:42.120
I will send your mum that picture
of you dressed up as Cher, OK?
One button.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.560
Cher? Celine Dion,
karaoke, harmless.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.560
Ollie told Emma that there's
a shit storm brewing
about minister's daughter.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.400
She was only the minister's
daughter, but she knew how to take
the collection! She's 12! Ah.

04:58.360 --> 05:03.240
Shit, strike that last remark,
it's actually a little poem
that gets much worse.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.640
Let's put a photo of her up, so we
know what we're steering clear of.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.400
You've got a photo? No, Phil!

05:08.400 --> 05:12.400
Nicola Murray's daughter, actually
that's not her, that's Tracy Beaker.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.280
She was down for an independent
school, but is now going here,

05:16.280 --> 05:20.600
local comprehensive,

05:16.280 --> 05:20.600
full of first trimester pregnancies

05:16.280 --> 05:20.600
and Croydon facelifts!

05:20.600 --> 05:24.160
What are you saying? It's wrong to
send your child to a comprehensive?

05:24.160 --> 05:25.960
Yeah, wrong. Or very careless!

05:25.960 --> 05:30.440
So one of the initiatives that
we've got is a national register

05:30.440 --> 05:36.240
of really extraordinary, ordinary
people, who we're gonna call
the "fourth sector pathfinders".

05:36.240 --> 05:41.920
What I want to try and bring to
mind is that amazing JFK speech,
you know that they can help you...

05:41.920 --> 05:46.240
Hey, come on, come on.
Yeah, yeah. "Ask not what your
country can do but what you,

05:46.240 --> 05:50.440
"what your country can do to help
you do to help you help yourself."

05:50.440 --> 05:54.159
Nicola, it's Martin Stone,
your daughter's headmaster.

05:54.159 --> 05:58.240
James can't come to the meeting
for your daughter's, er, problems.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.240
Thank you! For fuck's sake, Terri!

06:00.240 --> 06:01.760
Mr Stone, hi.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.960
It's the whole deserving and
undeserving poor argument
again though, isn't it?

06:05.960 --> 06:09.640
It's the chavs and chav-nots. Right,
Pinky and fucking Perky, listen.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.520
This fourth sector? Fucking mad!

06:11.520 --> 06:15.960
She's mad, she's like Tom Cruise's
favourite fucking brush,
but the great thing is

06:15.960 --> 06:21.880
it's free, so you two, I want you
to rub your dicks together and get
some fucking energy going in here!

06:21.880 --> 06:24.040
Inject yourself with stem cells

06:24.040 --> 06:27.120
or coke in your Fruit Corners,
just get on with something!

06:27.120 --> 06:28.680
Can I have a word?

06:28.680 --> 06:33.280
My husband has bailed on me,
so I'm gonna have to get to
Ella's school this afternoon.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.640
Nicola, the taxpayer
is not bankrolling you

06:35.640 --> 06:39.640
to do this sort of thing.
And if I want to get things done
I could get fucking

06:39.640 --> 06:42.760
big gingerbread man there to
pop out and get me a fucking gun.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.280
See me after school.

06:44.280 --> 06:49.360
OK, OK, just you, then.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.440
So, can you work out this
whole fourth sector thing?

06:52.440 --> 06:55.800
I can see you hate the idea, so
you'll be able to find the snags.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.640
Stuart. Aah, Peter.
I'm glad we could hook up.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.840
Just wanted to take a couple
of turns with you on the
ideas carousel, yeah?

07:03.840 --> 07:07.720
Think of ways we can turn your team
into a little cluster of excellence.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.120
You wanted to have a chat?
What's this?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.760
That's just Phil's
Klingon horoscope!

07:13.760 --> 07:16.880
It's an implementation matrix.
Well, clearly two axis lead

07:16.880 --> 07:20.600
to the mid-point to create four
diametrically opposed quadrants!

07:20.600 --> 07:23.680
I like the plasmic nature
of your data modelling! Nice!

07:23.680 --> 07:26.640
A child's photograph?
What is that doing up there?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.520
There, happy now?

07:28.520 --> 07:32.280
Now I'm confused! Who is that?
No-one, it's a Cylon Centurion.

07:32.280 --> 07:36.159
Phil, help me out here. Look, what
are these vectors, Posh and Shit?

07:36.159 --> 07:37.400
They refer to schools.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.440
You see, Murray's daughter was down

07:37.400 --> 07:42.440
to go here, sort of teeny-Sloany

07:37.400 --> 07:42.440
independent girls' school,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.880
but she's been moved here -
a comprehensive in the middle
of a poor area.

07:45.880 --> 07:51.360
First, she opts out of the state
education system, which is bad,

07:51.360 --> 07:58.280
then, presumably under pressure from
the party machine, she says, "Sod
your life-chances, Cylon, darling,

07:58.280 --> 08:02.720
"Mummy's going to send you here" -
to save her political career.
Badissimo!

08:02.720 --> 08:06.880
So, how are we going to deploy this?

08:02.720 --> 08:06.880
We're not!

08:06.880 --> 08:14.160
The point of departure is this...
"Knowledge is porridge"!

08:14.160 --> 08:19.280
Oh, Jesus, Stuart,
that doesn't even fucking rhyme!

08:19.280 --> 08:21.560
Let me have a go! All right.

08:21.560 --> 08:26.920
Look, suppose we are saying that
Nicola Murray should have stuck to
her guns and sent her daughter here,

08:26.920 --> 08:30.400
Posh, you see, Stuart,
I can do this stuff. Then we look...

08:30.400 --> 08:33.120
elitist, out of touch with
ordinary parents,

08:33.120 --> 08:39.799
or do we say,
"No, Posh is wrongissimo"?

08:39.799 --> 08:43.480
OK, look, look, look, let's pause,
yeah, let's switch off the sat nav,

08:43.480 --> 08:47.200
pull over, electric soft-top
back on, switch off the engine.

08:47.200 --> 08:51.440
I'm not getting in the back seat
with you, if this is where
this game is going!

08:51.440 --> 08:54.120
Let's imagine the narrative.
Oh, goody!

08:54.120 --> 08:58.240
So let's imagine in the narrative
that Peter here may know something

08:58.240 --> 09:02.840
about this, but refuses to tell you.
"It's beneath his dignity", say.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.520
I hate to be a spoilsport, but can
we refocus on our visit to DoSAC
Yeah, who you meeting?

09:07.520 --> 09:11.760
I've got a couple of meetings
with the two top people - the
big swinging dicks.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.920
Don't forget the tiny static dicks.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.200
We're not allowed to talk
to her boyfriend.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.720
Funny(!) What about Terri Coverley?

09:16.200 --> 09:19.720
Ollie said she's utter shit.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.760
Let's make an appointment for Peter

09:19.720 --> 09:22.760
to take her out for a latte.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.600
See if she spills the coffee beans!

09:22.760 --> 09:25.600
Great(!)

09:25.600 --> 09:29.360
Thank you. Mrs Murray, thanks
for coming. Mr Stone, thank you.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.520
Sorry, is your husband not with you?

09:31.520 --> 09:36.280
No, sorry. That's disappointing,
cos I was hoping to speak to
both of you about this. Yeah.

09:36.280 --> 09:39.920
I did actually want to come and see
you anyway. Oh? On a separate issue.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.720
I wondered if you'd
be interested in becoming
a Fourth Sector Pathfinder?

09:43.720 --> 09:51.320
I don't know what that actually
means, but I do look fantastic
in a safari suit! Oh, right!

09:51.320 --> 09:53.120
I'm sure you do!
Put that to one side!

09:53.120 --> 09:58.880
Yes, obviously. As we know, Ella's,

09:53.120 --> 09:58.880
let's say, challenging behaviour

09:53.120 --> 09:58.880
has reached a critical point.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.440
There was an incident yesterday.

10:01.440 --> 10:06.360
Ella and some accomplices
attacked another year seven girl

10:06.360 --> 10:09.200
with a pair of hair straighteners,
pinned her down...

10:09.200 --> 10:10.920
this girl has quite curly hair

10:10.920 --> 10:13.120
and Ella set about ironing it.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.800
Oh, my God!

10:16.080 --> 10:18.360
Right, they're here!

10:18.360 --> 10:22.080
Has anyone seen my implementation
file? Is that it over there?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.480
Yeah, thanks, Glen.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.720
Is this you, Glen? No, it's Ollie!
You know what he's like!

10:27.720 --> 10:29.520
Well, it's puerile!

10:29.520 --> 10:31.120
I've had to call bloody IT.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.840
Ollie's put some kind of
awful screensaver on!

10:33.840 --> 10:37.880
How do you disable it?
It's not funny, Glen!

10:37.880 --> 10:41.400
I know, I'm not laughing!
Have you met Mr Darcy yet, then?

10:41.400 --> 10:45.880
Has he swung in through the window
in a little top hat
and smoking jacket?

10:45.880 --> 10:49.800
This feedback is really, really
so encouraging!

10:49.800 --> 10:52.600
Having trouble with the
four sector ring-around?

10:52.600 --> 10:55.720
No, I just ring people up and say
"Do you think this is shite?"

10:55.720 --> 10:57.440
They say "yes". I agree, that's it.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.120
What have you been doing?

10:59.120 --> 11:03.160
I've actually been making
some Peter Mannion face masks.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.440
Ha-ha! Excellent!

11:06.320 --> 11:11.000
Oh, Terri, me beauty,
I like the heft of your jib!

11:11.000 --> 11:14.600
Oh, dear, I'm going all
boogie-woogie downstairs!

11:17.560 --> 11:20.800
Hello! Hi, Ollie,
I've got a bit of news for you.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.280
Right, you're pregnant are you?

11:23.280 --> 11:28.160
No, I'm not fucking pregnant!

11:23.280 --> 11:28.160
So what's your... What is your news?

11:28.160 --> 11:33.800
It's the Nicola Murray daughter
thing, you know the switching
from private to state.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.400
They know about it here.
Thank you, Emma! How?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.240
Phil! 'Tell Phil I'm gonna take his'

11:39.240 --> 11:44.040
stupid fucking lightsaver
collection and shove it slowly
through his eye sockets, right?

11:44.040 --> 11:49.200
How has Ella been behaving at home,
let's say over the last week or so?

11:49.200 --> 11:53.320
Well, not fantastically good,
apparently! Sorry, apparently?

11:53.320 --> 11:55.520
Because the pathfinder initiative

11:55.520 --> 12:00.640
is taking up very much all
of my time. I haven't seen Ella.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.880
And has your husband been round?

12:02.880 --> 12:06.160
Meet my husband!
He's never really there!

12:06.160 --> 12:07.800
Let me put my cards on the table.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.080
This incident with the hair
straighteners was so severe,

12:11.080 --> 12:16.960
OK, that I have no option but to
exclude Ella from this school,
with immediate effect.

12:16.960 --> 12:21.240
You'll be taking her home with you.

12:16.960 --> 12:21.240
No, I can't do that.

12:16.960 --> 12:21.240
I can't have her with me.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.360
Answer that phone,
it's driving me...

12:23.360 --> 12:25.320
I'm so sorry! I will be back.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.080
Ollie, what is it?
This had better be important!

12:28.080 --> 12:31.360
Mannion's team
know about the school switch.

12:32.320 --> 12:37.440
You shouldn't worry because
there's no way the press will run
with this. It's a personal thing.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.440
Ella's been bullying other
kids and, um

12:41.440 --> 12:44.920
they're threatening to exclude her.
What?

12:44.920 --> 12:48.200
What's going on? Hey, at least
they're not going to expel her.

12:48.200 --> 12:53.000
It's the same fucking thing.
That's what they say
to make it sound better.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.360
'It's the same old shit!'

12:54.360 --> 12:56.320
No, oh, right, oh, right.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.080
'This is just so awful and Ollie'

12:59.080 --> 13:01.720
I'm such a crap mum,
I'm such a crap mum.

13:01.720 --> 13:06.800
No, no, you're not, you're really
good, you're a pathfinder mum,
that's what you are!

13:06.800 --> 13:11.120
Yeah, well, I made my daughter
come to this fucking school,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.800
away from all her friends, and she's
turned into a total fucking droog!

13:16.160 --> 13:18.160
Yeah, but...

13:19.160 --> 13:20.840
You know...

13:20.840 --> 13:24.120
That's it? Thanks, Ollie, good
to know you're there for me(!)

13:25.320 --> 13:27.600
What is this wheelie bin of misery?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.800
Do I, do I gather Ella is bullying?

13:30.800 --> 13:32.680
You have to keep this to yourself.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.200
OK, this is...Press can't use it.

13:35.200 --> 13:40.240
You and I just keep it between
ourselves. OK. No need to tell
Terri.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.920
OK. Good, good.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.000
Unbelievable!

13:44.000 --> 13:51.240
£6.50 booking fee for every

13:44.000 --> 13:51.240
single person I'm taking in my party

13:44.000 --> 13:51.240
of ten. It sounds serious, Terri.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.800
Any news from Nicola? No! Nothing.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.400
We're in! Philip,
you're not in Mission Impossible.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.720
Some guy just made contact.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.360
Looks like an Ewok,

14:01.360 --> 14:04.520
small patch of white hair
on left temple.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.280
'That's Robert King, the civil
servant who used to work with Bert.'

14:08.280 --> 14:11.760
Ollie said he's a bit of a druid.
Who is that bloke staring at us?

14:11.760 --> 14:13.840
That's actually a woman!

14:13.840 --> 14:18.400
Oh, Christ! I'm not losing
my touch, I just haven't got
my distance glasses with me.

14:18.400 --> 14:23.800
The old Bangkok exoneration!
Route one excuse for accidentally
having a go on a transsexual.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.240
Christ, she's a bit creepy.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.920
looks like she's going
to launch herself at us!

14:30.920 --> 14:33.640
Emma, we've got a woman
staring at us from a balcony.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.960
Dark hair, like in a bob,
looks like she's in her own world
and has got lost there.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.360
Oh, that's Terri...that will be
Terri Coverley. The shit one?
Yeah, she's a shit one.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.880
All right.
Well, she might be worth a chat-up.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.240
See if she's due a
binning when the inevitable occurs!

14:48.240 --> 14:51.080
Everything all right with
the path people? Pathfinders!

14:51.080 --> 14:56.160
So, exclusion is massive, isn't it?

14:56.160 --> 15:01.080
Well, I'm sorry but the guidelines -
the guidelines which your government
introduced, remember -

15:01.080 --> 15:06.800
with quite a splash of
publicity, perfectly clear -
zero tolerance on bullying, zero.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.720
It's just the press would
have a field day...

15:10.720 --> 15:12.280
with this, you know...

15:12.280 --> 15:16.200
government minister who
bangs on about...

15:16.200 --> 15:22.080
protecting the vulnerable from the
brutalising effect of injustice,
ha-ha-ha, her daughter's a bully and

15:22.080 --> 15:25.960
ha-ha-ha, she's a
completely shit mum and...

15:25.960 --> 15:30.520
Sorry, I don't swear at home,
actually. You're not
a bad mother, I'm sure.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.760
Just...

15:32.760 --> 15:35.880
maybe not entirely present
all the time.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.800
Yeah.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.080
Are you all right, Mrs Murray?

15:41.080 --> 15:45.120
Um yeah, yeah, I'm fine,
I'm just resting my face.

15:45.120 --> 15:50.160
Now hang on, there's a complete
fucking penis in my building who
I need to have a word with.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.280
All right, I'll speak to you later.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.560
Oi, oi, James fucking May,

15:55.080 --> 15:59.560
you sprayed the private information

15:55.080 --> 15:59.560
about the school,

15:59.560 --> 16:01.840
like Jenson Button
shaking up a magnum of piss!

16:01.840 --> 16:05.640
Listen to yourself! At first
it was private information
between you and your boss,

16:05.640 --> 16:08.360
then between you and your
girlfriend,

16:08.360 --> 16:12.160
then it was private information
between your girlfriend
and her colleagues.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.640
I could draw you a diagram if you
like. It's like a fucking swine
'flu pandemic!

16:15.640 --> 16:17.880
I've made an error, I'll talk to
Emma but you should...

16:17.880 --> 16:20.440
It's your fault! ..fucking use if
for political... No, no!

16:20.440 --> 16:23.560
You're like the man who fucked
the monkey that gave us AIDS!

16:23.560 --> 16:26.760
I'm like the man who did what? Who
fucked the monkey that gave us AIDS?

16:26.760 --> 16:29.280
I tell you something and
you're saying, it wasn't me,

16:29.280 --> 16:31.680
and there's monkey shit
on your balls, not mine!

16:31.680 --> 16:36.560
I love it, I love it, it's the
pre-match spy for the big
super gay weight title fight, eh!

16:36.560 --> 16:39.040
OK, Oliver, wipe away the pre-come.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.480
Have you got some work to
get on with? Yeah, Malcolm... What?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.440
The Nicola thing I think is
getting a bit worse.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.840
It looks like her daughter is
about to be excluded for bullying.
Yeah, well Glen told me that.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.360
What? When did...

16:50.360 --> 16:54.600
Yeah, the thing is all we've
gotta do is to try and keep this
info very very closely contained,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.480
we'll be all right, yeah?
OK. OK? OK! Way to go!

16:57.480 --> 16:59.560
OK, Shitehead Revisited,

16:59.560 --> 17:03.600
Did you know Nicola Murray's
daughter is about to be expelled
for fucking bullying!

17:03.600 --> 17:05.760
What are you doing? No... what?

17:05.760 --> 17:08.599
Don't worry. Did you not know that?
No, why would I?

17:08.599 --> 17:12.359
Because you wouldn't know that,
because the only people who know
are Mrs Murray,

17:12.359 --> 17:14.560
her daughter, Ollie and me, yeah.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.760
If this gets into the press,
I would know that it came from you!

17:18.760 --> 17:20.920
Clever!

17:22.560 --> 17:24.960
And I would rain down
upon you so hard

17:24.960 --> 17:28.840
that you would have to be
reassembled by fucking air-crash
investigators.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.760
What... Do not fucking
interrupt me son, ever.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.560
Now get this into the noggin, right?

17:33.560 --> 17:37.560
You breathe a word of this to
anyone,

17:37.560 --> 17:42.200
you mincing fucking CUNT and I will
tear your fucking skin off,

17:42.200 --> 17:46.520
I will wear it to your mother's
birthday party and I will rub your
nuts up and down her leg

17:46.520 --> 17:48.960
while whistling Bohemian
fucking Rhapsody, right?

17:48.960 --> 17:51.000
Yeah. Now...

17:51.000 --> 17:54.520
get out of my fucking sight!

17:58.360 --> 18:03.400
I've been kind of a target
for the press and I just...

18:04.920 --> 18:08.480
I don't want Ella suffering
on my account, really.

18:08.480 --> 18:16.480
Look, it's possible, theoretically
possible, I could park the
exclusion temporarily, maybe.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.440
That would...
That would just be so great!

18:18.440 --> 18:23.240
But we would need to draw up a pupil
behavioural contract, you and your
husband together... Obviously.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.360
And Ella.
Thank you so much, thank you,
Mr Stone, really I owe you one...

18:27.360 --> 18:30.400
and I'll talk to you on a separate
occasion about the other thing.

18:30.400 --> 18:35.960
Streetwalkers thing? Pathfinders
thing, yeah. That was a joke!
Very good!

18:35.960 --> 18:37.720
All right, thanks for your help.

18:37.720 --> 18:41.680
Where are you going?
I'm going through a thing with
Malcolm about Nicola's daughter.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.040
She's being excluded from school.
Don't tell anyone.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.240
Everyone knows that. It's all over!
A civil servant told me.

18:47.240 --> 18:51.400
Oh, shit. I'm straight to DVD,
I'm the night shift!
Malcolm's gonna kill me!

18:51.400 --> 18:53.960
His bark's worse than his bite!

18:53.960 --> 18:56.960
Peter! Speaking
of rabies injections, here he is!

18:56.960 --> 19:00.960
I didn't know you were
still alive! How's the old
80s tribute band going?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.360
Still doing the Robert
Palmer lookalikey thing, huh?

19:03.360 --> 19:06.760
Malcolm, you're looking well
for someone twice your age!

19:06.760 --> 19:09.440
Any news on the aneurism?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.880
Funny man, funny, funny man!
See you later.

19:12.880 --> 19:17.440
Why don't you find out how their
data back-up works? I've got a
meeting with leaky Terri!

19:17.440 --> 19:19.120
Oh! That sounded wrong!

19:23.800 --> 19:26.120
Let's talk about the daughter's
social networking.

19:26.120 --> 19:30.520
Is she on Facebook or Bebo,
does she Twitter, are any of her
victims on Facebook or Twitter?

19:30.520 --> 19:35.320
On the left we've got guardian.
What's the weather like over the
guardian? How do we counter-massage?

19:35.320 --> 19:39.040
To be honest, I'm just curious
as to what the press is going
to make of this.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.400
Of course you are, which
is the entire purpose of the
matrix to begin with.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.360
Look, what I want to do is

19:42.400 --> 19:46.360
graphicise and three-dimensionalise

19:42.400 --> 19:46.360
our response.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.080
Stage one, story leaks.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.160
Our response, we move
forward to stage two.

19:51.160 --> 19:55.560
What's our re-response when the
press come back to us and then we
move forward to stage three.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.400
What's our response to their
response to our response?

19:58.400 --> 20:02.040
We've gotta think
multi-dimensionally.
It's fractal retaliation!

20:02.040 --> 20:04.760
Mm-hm. Do you fancy a cup of tea?

20:04.760 --> 20:06.960
Yeah. Have you got anything herbal?
OK, yeah.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.480
I'm sorry, do you smoke?

20:08.480 --> 20:10.720
Hmm. They low tar?

20:10.720 --> 20:13.720
Mm-hm. That's my favourite!

20:13.720 --> 20:17.360
We're a dying breed, eh?
Oh, yes, er...

20:19.040 --> 20:22.960
We've met before, when you were
at Defra as a junior minister.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.040
Oh, sorry, I don't remember!
Were you at the department?

20:26.040 --> 20:28.360
No, no, no, I was at Sainsbury's.

20:28.360 --> 20:35.280
Press, not on the tills and
I set up the photo shoot for you
with the sustainable sea bass...

20:35.280 --> 20:40.200
and I remember you made some
kind of quip about something
to do with fishnets...

20:41.720 --> 20:45.600
..cos there was a girl who was
wearing stockings.
Well, that certainly dates it.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.520
You wouldn't be able to
make that kind of comment now!

20:49.520 --> 20:52.160
More's the pity!

20:52.160 --> 20:56.880
How's Nicola coping,
some trouble with her daughter,
bullying or something?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.720
Is her daughter being bullied?

20:58.720 --> 21:00.600
The poor little thing!

21:00.600 --> 21:04.240
Just because she's
put on a bit of weight!

21:04.240 --> 21:05.880
PHONE RINGS

21:05.880 --> 21:09.920
Ah Stuart, what flavour of nut-brown
piss are you gonna pour into my ear?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.840
How's the info pump firing?

21:11.840 --> 21:15.760
What you mean Terri Coverley?
She's useless, she knows nothing,
but you'd get on!

21:15.760 --> 21:19.600
Well, she may not know the story,
Peter, but just about
everybody else does

21:19.600 --> 21:23.640
so according to the matrix
here, we're looking at an 83 to
90% chance of this story

21:23.640 --> 21:27.480
making it, and if it does,
well someone's gonna use it
and if someone is,

21:27.480 --> 21:29.560
then that someone
should be us, yeah?

21:29.560 --> 21:31.320
No way. 'Peter, listen.'

21:31.320 --> 21:36.720
No-one is more shocked than I am
at the chain of events here, OK?

21:36.720 --> 21:40.640
How about you getting back here so
we can have a little de-brief?
Fuck that, Stuart!

21:40.640 --> 21:42.160
We are not going to use this story.

21:42.160 --> 21:47.440
I'd love to natter. Unfortunately
I think I've got another
call coming through.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.200
Peter, hello!

21:49.200 --> 21:50.880
Did you want another fag?

21:50.880 --> 21:54.960
Can I see Nicola? Well, that's a
bit of a protocol-ly thing, so...

21:54.960 --> 21:58.520
It's a personal matter. I'll just...

22:00.240 --> 22:04.040
What the fuck is he doing here?
Have you locked the building
so he can't get out?

22:04.040 --> 22:07.640
Could I have a word about
your school situation?

22:07.640 --> 22:12.320
It's no big deal, really, it's just
that old perennial...should I send
my kids to public school?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.560
I meant about the bullying.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.160
Er, right. Can you...

22:16.160 --> 22:18.960
come in, sit down, Peter.
How do you know about that?

22:18.960 --> 22:23.600
Well, everyone here knows and some
of our lot know. Some of your lot
know?

22:23.600 --> 22:28.560
Quite a lot of pressure on me
from above to use it but I just
wanted you to know that I won't.

22:28.560 --> 22:34.280
Thank you. I'd like to think I'd do
the same for you. I think I would.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.960
It's only DoSAC!

22:37.960 --> 22:43.920
Sock of shit! Sorry,
it's what we call DoSAC over there
in the enemy camp...

22:43.920 --> 22:47.160
social affairs citizenship
soc af sit,

22:47.160 --> 22:49.720
sock of shit, no disrespect!

22:49.720 --> 22:51.320
A bit of time on your
hands over in...

22:51.320 --> 22:54.720
on the dark side!
I'll leave you to get on with it.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.800
Thank you for doing
the honourable thing.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.720
Shit!

23:05.160 --> 23:07.880
Have you just Googled that?
What is that?

23:07.880 --> 23:10.960
Ollie did that, nothing to do with
me! I don't want to fellate you!

23:10.960 --> 23:15.040
Well, I know I'm planning
big changes around here but
nothing along those lines!

23:15.040 --> 23:17.880
Get in my office now, and you, Glen.

23:17.880 --> 23:21.960
Mannion knows about Ella and I
want to know how. Who did you tell?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.360
I only told Glen, I
only mentioned to Glen...

23:24.360 --> 23:26.160
I only told Malcolm!
You told Malcolm what?

23:26.160 --> 23:28.560
Ella has been excluded for...

23:28.560 --> 23:34.040
Nearly! Nearly excluded for
bullying other children.
What, she's the bully? Yes, yes.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.680
Ooh, ooh, that's nasty!
Well, that's helpful.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.440
Could you keep your fucking
opinions to yourself, please!

23:39.440 --> 23:42.160
Well, you can't use it, can you?
So who told you?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.080
Coverley, comms.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.440
Sorry, Nicola, just got
to take this. Ollie Reader.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.000
You're saying you do know about it?

23:48.000 --> 23:52.840
She's looking a bit upset, yeah.
Right, but you're not gonna use it?
Thanks for telling us, yeah, sure.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.440
Obviously you can't use it but...

23:52.840 --> 23:55.440
You know about it, do you?

23:55.440 --> 24:00.120
I'm going home. I'm gonna see my
daughter, I'm gonna give her a big
kiss and the bollocking of her life!

24:00.120 --> 24:03.320
Nicola, just got a text from
Malcolm. He says he knows Mannion
was here.

24:03.320 --> 24:08.760
Text reads, "I know about your
fucking meeting with that aging
flamenco guitarist.

24:08.760 --> 24:12.400
"You are not... letters... to go
home, there's been an escalation".

24:12.400 --> 24:16.360
Shit. He wants you at Number 10,
ASAFP. Come on, let's go!

24:16.360 --> 24:17.960
"F" meaning...

24:17.960 --> 24:19.960
Feasibly, I should imagine!

24:22.280 --> 24:25.080
Stuart, you're still here!

24:25.080 --> 24:26.960
To what do I owe this pain?

24:26.960 --> 24:32.160
It's called politics, Peter. We're
trying to do it from your office.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.640
I've told Nicola Murray
I'm not capitalising on that story.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.920
I'm speechless! Do you want to get
booted out of the Shadow Cabinet?

24:38.920 --> 24:44.240
You're wanting to spend more time
hiding from your wife in the
greenhouse? Yes, if it came to it!

24:44.240 --> 24:49.240
If you have to wade through all this
shit to win the election then
I'm happy to lose it, all right?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.720
Malcolm.

24:50.720 --> 24:54.320
Hi Nicola, thanks very much for
coming over. Can I get you
something?

24:54.320 --> 24:57.480
Actually, you haven't got any
whisky, have you? Whisky, yeah.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.160
Hasn't been touched for a while.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.080
Still got Anthony Eden's
lipstick on the bottle!

25:02.080 --> 25:04.160
Hey, do you remember
when you started?

25:04.160 --> 25:06.680
I said I didn't have
much of a folder on you.

25:06.680 --> 25:11.880
You should see it now!
It's like a fucking butcher's
slab and just as graphic!

25:11.880 --> 25:14.240
Right, so, can we...

25:14.240 --> 25:17.600
I need to go home.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.600
You said there'd been an escalation?

25:17.600 --> 25:22.240
The good news is that even though
everybody's got this brilliant
story, no-one can use it. Good.

25:22.240 --> 25:26.520
But? I'm sensing there is a
"but", probably be
the size of a fucking house.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.720
The bad news is that
they will run with

25:28.720 --> 25:32.840
"head teacher bends the rules and
gives preferential treatment
to Cabinet minister."

25:32.840 --> 25:34.520
It's unacceptable.

25:34.520 --> 25:38.600
The Board of Governors have no
choice. He'll have to resign.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.440
No, no, no, no!

25:40.440 --> 25:42.640
Yeah, I'm afraid it's
"fuck off, Mr Chips!".

25:42.640 --> 25:45.120
No! It should be me who resigns.

25:45.120 --> 25:50.120
If you resign now, you'll be up
there with the fucking shaggers
and the expenses fiddlers

25:50.120 --> 25:54.320
and the guys who asphyxiate
themselves having a wank in the
Travelodge and your daughter,

25:54.320 --> 26:00.320
your Ella, she would be publicly,
and very, very fucking horribly,
humiliated.

26:00.320 --> 26:05.680
Now, that is not something that
helps anybody. It does... Hey, hey,
hey, come on look, that is not,
look...

26:05.680 --> 26:07.080
It doesn't...

26:08.280 --> 26:12.600
That's not a plan, is it, Stan? Come
on. That's not an agenda, Brenda!

26:12.600 --> 26:14.120
Come on.

26:16.080 --> 26:19.240
And I'm staying here to do what?

26:19.240 --> 26:22.240
Exactly, because I
don't feel like I'm...

26:22.240 --> 26:23.400
Sorry.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.400
I don't feel like I'm
really making things better.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.080
Listen, Nicky, this,
it's a war, right?

26:31.080 --> 26:32.800
It's a fucking war.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.520
Now you can't change
a thing unless you win the war

26:36.520 --> 26:40.160
and you cannot win the war
unless you're prepared to fight.

26:40.160 --> 26:46.840
That's what this is all about for
you, isn't it? It's just about
fighting and fucking...power!

26:46.840 --> 26:52.160
Does it never occur to you
that your poisonous male
obsession with conflict,

26:52.160 --> 26:57.320
which is making people
despise politics and, by the way,
don't ever fucking call me Nicky!

26:57.320 --> 27:00.040
Spare me
a fucking psycho-fanny, right?

27:00.040 --> 27:02.920
What do you think fucking
Mannion is doing right now?

27:02.920 --> 27:05.480
Michael Aspel's cooler
fucking younger brother?

27:05.480 --> 27:08.720
I'll tell you what he's doing.
He's sitting around with his pals.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.320
D'you know what they're doing?

27:10.320 --> 27:13.920
They're telling very fucking
nasty jokes about your family!

27:13.920 --> 27:18.520
They're playing fucking pin the cock
on the fucking donkey's face

27:18.520 --> 27:21.440
with your face there cos you're
the fucking donkey, right!

27:21.440 --> 27:24.320
So you should just
fucking count your blessings!

27:24.320 --> 27:26.360
Ella's not been excluded.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.040
That's what you wanted, right?

27:29.040 --> 27:35.400
Yeah! Yes! I really wanted Ella to
be able to stay at a shit school,
the only redeeming feature of which

27:35.400 --> 27:38.560
was a headmaster who, thanks
to me, has now been forced out.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.360
Yeah well er...

27:41.360 --> 27:42.880
maybe...

27:44.760 --> 27:47.840
Maybe in a term or so, you know...

27:47.840 --> 27:51.120
we might understand if you...

27:51.120 --> 27:52.960
very quietly decide to move her.

27:52.960 --> 27:56.520
Really? Yeah!

27:58.560 --> 28:01.120
Good, good, OK, so it's Mannion.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.040
What do we do? I mean do we...

28:04.040 --> 28:06.080
go after him with one of your
things that you say,

28:06.080 --> 28:09.600
like a big bum dildo of
vengeance sort of something?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.760
As you go, that's my girl, yeah!

28:11.760 --> 28:16.440
Indiana Murray and the
Bum Dildo of Vengeance! I like you!

28:16.440 --> 28:21.680
Hey, do you want
his mobile number?

28:21.680 --> 28:24.680
That was Nicola Murray.
She says from now on,

28:24.680 --> 28:29.320
nothing in my private life is off
limits. Has she got anything she
could use?

28:29.320 --> 28:32.560
No, I don't think so.
He took a piss against Big Ben
on his stag night.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.120
I won't use that and the love
child's been and gone. Yeah.

28:35.120 --> 28:40.280
We could have had shots of
her scuttling into her house,
scurrying out again to make

28:40.280 --> 28:45.400
some humiliating public statement

28:40.280 --> 28:45.400
surrounded by members of her family

28:40.280 --> 28:45.400
all grinning like Alsatians.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.400
Do you remember that, Peter, when
the pregnant mistress story broke?

28:48.400 --> 28:53.400
You and Mrs Mannion standing
on your doorstep, her never
gonna touch little Peter again?

28:53.400 --> 28:56.600
The press talking about
"Cheater Mannion"!

28:56.600 --> 29:00.600
Everyone reading about how you
like to make love to Geoff
Wayne's "War of the Worlds".
