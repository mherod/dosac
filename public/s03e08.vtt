WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:07.920
This programme contains
strong language and adult humour

00:07.920 --> 00:11.160
That's what we masters of
the dark arts call a blip.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.440
We need to start booting up
this crime stats inquiry.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.000
Julius, what is the deal? At the
moment, Malcolm is getting the sack.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.320
You, fucking speak! You've always
fucking got something to say.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.400
I'm only a cabinet minister!
Fuck off then.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.240
Malcolm Tucker has resigned.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:26.240 --> 00:29.000
Happy days!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.480
You will fucking see me again!

00:32.520 --> 00:35.280
Malcolm! Malcolm!

00:32.520 --> 00:35.280
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

00:35.680 --> 00:37.440
Let me in. No.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.400
Watch the hedge. Watch the hedge.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.640
I'm just trying to get home, please.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.560
Show's over, OK? Fucking bacteria.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.240
You know, I just can't
quite believe this.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.600
This is the single most
shocking thing I've seen

00:53.600 --> 00:54.960
in politics since the SDP.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.680
I thought he'd at least go out
with a bang, or a killing spree.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.160
I always imagined he'd just
shout so hard

01:00.160 --> 01:02.880
his lungs would come up
and choke him to death.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.239
End of an era.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.720
A really shit era
though, isn't it? Whooooo!

01:07.720 --> 01:09.400
Yeah, all right, calm down.
Balrog's dead!

01:09.400 --> 01:11.480
I mean, that's it. They're done.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.880
No-one can replace him. It's like
when Queen lost Freddie.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.480
Certainly not Paul Rodgers. Right,
that's the two seconds of respect

01:17.480 --> 01:20.440
due to him, now get back
to your desks and do something, OK?

01:20.440 --> 01:23.280
Not the sofa, who are you,
Lorraine Kelly? Get out here

01:23.280 --> 01:25.440
and do something.
If you've nothing to do, leave,

01:25.440 --> 01:28.440
because you're clearly
surplus to requirements.

01:28.440 --> 01:32.920
Um, lads and lasses.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.120
Please, just a quick word,
thank you.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.160
Really, it's just a handhold,

01:38.160 --> 01:43.479
to set the tone
for a slightly rejigged regime.

01:43.479 --> 01:46.200
I've done
all the important departments,

01:46.200 --> 01:47.680
and now I've got to you.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.280
Seriously, I've done
that joke everywhere,

01:52.280 --> 01:55.759
even with the genuinely
big departments.

01:55.759 --> 02:00.240
I'm not aiming at you
in any sort of a snide way.

02:00.240 --> 02:04.760
I'm just checking that we're all
at the very top of our games.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.440
Glenn? Mate? Sorry.

02:06.440 --> 02:10.240
Are you on top of your game?
I am... I'm above my game.

02:10.240 --> 02:17.360
I'm in a geostationary orbit,
way above it, looking down, going,
"Hello, game, it's Glenn!" Right.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.800
You know, there's an election
looming. This is a serious time.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.079
We need to be aware of that.

02:23.079 --> 02:27.160
But I love humour and
that was good humour.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.320
Do you want to swim the Channel
for Scope?

02:30.320 --> 02:34.800
No! Do you want to do
Dragons' Den for Children In Need?

02:34.800 --> 02:37.120
I'd rather fuck a real dragon.

02:37.120 --> 02:42.240
Would you consider promoting
a politically-themed restaurant?

02:42.240 --> 02:45.640
How does that... How does that
even work? Fuck, no, I don't care.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.800
Would you like to write a children's

02:45.640 --> 02:50.800
book called The Angry Spider?

02:50.800 --> 02:55.079
So, everything, good.

02:55.079 --> 02:58.040
Yeah, you know, a bit of instability

02:55.079 --> 02:58.040
with Malcolm gone.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.680
A sort of sense
of post-psychotic twat's disorder.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.960
No, no, listen. I understand.

03:04.960 --> 03:11.320
But you know, right now,

03:04.960 --> 03:11.320
you're all emerging from the cellar.

03:11.320 --> 03:18.240
Pleased that the beatings
have stopped, scared of
what the future might hold.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.560
But long-term, I think
we're all going to be OK.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.120
Pep-talk over!

03:25.120 --> 03:29.200
Return to your desks
and prepare for government.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.760
We're in government.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.880
Well then,
prepare to stay in government.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.160
All right. How do we do that?
Pack an overnight bag.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.920
Would you please fucking well...!

03:43.000 --> 03:45.079
Sorry, I lost my temper.

03:45.079 --> 03:47.880
Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.720
Oh, I've found it again,
it's all right!

03:49.720 --> 03:51.720
Always in the last
place you look, eh?

03:51.720 --> 03:53.440
So, can I... Yeah.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.200
Great. Actually, can I have a word
with you, Nicky? Yeah. Nicola.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.760
I just wanted to check...

04:00.760 --> 04:07.000
Obviously, Dan Miller's cabal
is going house-to-house through

04:07.000 --> 04:10.960
the cabinet looking for numbskulls
stupid enough to resign

04:10.960 --> 04:13.600
to trigger his elevation
to the throne.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.440
Obviously. What I need to know is,
are you solid?

04:19.440 --> 04:22.880
Yeah, I'm completely,
I'm solid as the proverbial.

04:22.880 --> 04:28.160
As a rock, as a rock, hard,
as a sailor's wang on shore leave.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.800
Superb.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.159
You really are
a potty mouth, aren't you?

04:33.159 --> 04:35.120
Well, a lot to do!

04:36.800 --> 04:38.880
Ollie, Glenn, in here now.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.040
Quick, quick. Glenn, don't faff
about with your glasses.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.080
You take them off every time you
come in here, it's not impressive.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.600
What do we know about
the anti-Tom cabal? Why have
I not been contacted by them?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.200
Because it would be... Um...

04:50.200 --> 04:53.280
You're seen very much
as an individual around the...

04:53.280 --> 04:57.560
That's bollocks.
It's cos I'm the girl at the party
nobody wants to dance with.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.840
I'm the freak in the corner

04:57.560 --> 05:01.840
with a pint of cider and blackcurrant

04:57.560 --> 05:01.840
and the funny eye.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.840
No, no. I mean, it's a big Rolodex
full of numbers...

05:04.840 --> 05:08.600
Thank you, you may go. We still
would like to dance with you.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.960
Fuck off! Go and put your glasses
back on.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.440
Malcolm?
Sarah Jennings. Welcome to the BBC.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.960
Did you have any trouble getting
here? No, I had trouble getting in.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.840
They thought I was a terrorist.
If you'd like to take
a seat down there.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.440
We're really very excited.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.240
Yeah. This could be
the highlight of my career.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.520
And I've taken a dump
in the White House.

05:28.520 --> 05:32.159
That's great banter, that's exactly
what we're looking for. Is it? 

05:32.159 --> 05:33.840
So, this pitch.

05:33.840 --> 05:41.480
It's for the sort of person
who tried coke once but didn't
like it - it's a BBC Three show.

05:41.480 --> 05:45.320
It's a bullshit description but,
you know, it paints a picture.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.000
Who didn't like coke?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.720
Oh! Yeah. So the idea is,
you're going to be

05:49.720 --> 05:53.560
talking to other people who, like
you, have been through the shits.

05:53.560 --> 05:58.480
For this, I was thinking
Brian Keenan? Kerry Katona?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.360
Sorry, do you mind?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.160
Sorry, I have got to take this.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.920
Yeah, no...no worries.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.800
We'll continue this. Yeah? Hello?

06:11.840 --> 06:14.800
Oh, hello. Where did you go
for lunch, Belgium?

06:14.800 --> 06:17.600
I was meeting a friend. Oh, right.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.280
Meanwhile, back in Gotham City,
the Express is running the idea

06:21.280 --> 06:25.000
that your victim support scheme
is actually a rapist's charter.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.880
And Steve Fleming wants
you to do some local media.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.160
There's this guy who's
very angry his dead mum

06:30.160 --> 06:33.400
keeps getting sent parking tickets,
so can we cover that?

06:33.400 --> 06:37.120
So, dead mum, rapists. Yep, all good.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.600
Ollie, could you assemble
a policy profile for me

06:40.600 --> 06:43.960
for the Centre for Economic Reform
out of Yale?

06:43.960 --> 06:48.600
Yes I can, why? Just curiosity -
it's a very interesting think tank.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.240
You haven't been offered
a job or anything, have you?

06:52.240 --> 06:55.560
You might comment.
I couldn't possibly say yes.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.960
I mean, if you've been offered
a job, we better start
looking around ourselves.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.840
You can't start planning an exit
from this department.
That would undermine me.

07:03.840 --> 07:09.320
Nicola, there's someone called

07:03.840 --> 07:09.320
Hannah on line three,

07:03.840 --> 07:09.320
she's from the Centre of Economic...

07:09.320 --> 07:11.680
Thank you, please scram. Sod off.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.400
Get out, don't go looking for jobs.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.160
So, what d'you reckon? Sod that,
we've got to put some feelers out.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.840
But we'll do it discreetly.
Yeah, like you do on the Tube.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.240
I suppose it is the end now
for you two, the full stop.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.760
After all those commas,

07:25.240 --> 07:28.760
a few little semi-colons on the way.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.040
I wouldn't be quite so smug, Terri.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.800
Because I heard from very good
sources that the opposition
will be getting the Fucker in.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.280
Yep, that's what I heard too.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.560
They're definitely getting the
Fucker in. I haven't heard that.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.800
The Fucker, he coming.
He coming to your town.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.200
You do know why they call him
the Fucker, don't you, Terri?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.760
Yes. Sorry, not you.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.880
Is it because he's
a bit of a fucker?

07:50.880 --> 07:53.280
It's not going to be easy
for Peter Mannion.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.200
He's not going to be reading
The Wind In The Willows,
sipping camomile tea.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.400
He's going to have a crash helmet,
bent over, doing his best

07:59.400 --> 08:03.240
to be heard over a force 10 fucking
from the Fucker. Piers, hello.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.360
Hello, Philip Schofield.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.000
I fuck lobsters for money.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.080
Take the rice first. Thank you.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.120
I want you to be very clear, Malc,
why it is that I've brought you in.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.160
That fine, that's fine. D'you know
what hat it is that I'm wearing?

08:28.160 --> 08:29.840
Is it your baldy swimming cap wig?

08:29.840 --> 08:32.720
No, it's my government
trouble-shooter Stetson,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.960
which is a long way from my
Homburg of sober inquiry.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.880
Do you know I'm thinking
about doing a television programme?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.000
I had heard something
on the grapevine.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.200
You know that programme Civilisation
with Kenneth Clarke? Yes.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.280
It's going to be like that, except
with fucking more quim, you know?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.160
It's me, Simon Schama
and Alan Yentob,

08:49.160 --> 08:52.520
in a cage, fucking lump hammer each,
whacking the shit out of each other.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.800
The last man standing
wins a fucking Ford Focus.

08:54.800 --> 09:00.880
The thing is, Malcolm, your

08:54.800 --> 09:00.880
departure has basically precipitated

08:54.800 --> 09:00.880
a call to arms, in effect.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.600
We have it on reasonably
good authority that there are

09:03.600 --> 09:07.000
between three to four cabinet
ministers who are disgruntled,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
and are planning
a mass resignation.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.560
That means, very simply,
a Dan Miller coronation.

09:11.560 --> 09:17.600
As my nephew would say, this shit
just got real. Your nephew?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.760
Yeah, he's at Charterhouse.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.280
Only a day boy, not a boarder.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.480
Anyway, the fact is,
it has to be stopped.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.880
And there have been a number
of ideas being tossed around,

09:28.880 --> 09:32.960
and one of them is,
would you be prepared to come back?

09:34.560 --> 09:37.560
Are you out of your
tiny shiny fucking mind?

09:37.560 --> 09:42.360
Look, we can do this simply.
Step one, are you interested?
Of course you are.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.920
Step two, will you come back?

09:44.920 --> 09:46.360
Yes?

09:46.360 --> 09:49.440
Superb. Step 3.
This is the important step.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.760
Will you use your considerable
influence to destroy the cabal?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.480
Can I drop it down?

09:55.480 --> 09:59.600
Fandabbydozy!
Step four, it's party time.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.120
Let's tool up with basmati rice
and wahay!

10:03.120 --> 10:05.280
You're asking me...

10:05.280 --> 10:09.920
Come back here and mop up the fucking
splatter from my own assassination?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.040
You know where the bodies
are buried.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.400
We'll just say you're coming back
to advise. It's election strategy.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.160
Not a day-to-day
Government business role.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.680
I can't come back unless I know
that I'm in the clear in your report.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.840
I'm not in a position to discuss
that. Not with my current hat on.

10:25.840 --> 10:32.400
However, would I be sat here now,
if the man in the other hat,
which is also me,

10:32.400 --> 10:35.920
wasn't sure that everyone
involved in this inquiry

10:35.920 --> 10:38.200
didn't come out relatively well?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.520
And what about Steve Fleming, yeah?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.440
You schizo hat-fuck.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.160
Let me put it this way.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.960
You see this onion bhajee?

10:45.960 --> 10:51.480
Let us just pretend

10:45.960 --> 10:51.480
for a minute that that onion bhajee

10:45.960 --> 10:51.480
is the problems that would be caused

10:51.480 --> 10:55.240
by a report that criticised
you or Steve Fleming. Hmm?

10:55.240 --> 10:56.760
Watch.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.000
You see what I'm doing?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.680
I'm eating the onion bhajee.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.240
Why?

11:06.240 --> 11:09.680
Because I'm the man that
makes the bhajee go away.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.400
There's a rumour that you're
getting the Fucker in. Are you lot
getting the Fucker in?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.760
Look, if you are, just say
the word "Fucker." Uh...

11:15.760 --> 11:17.520
Hey! I'll call you back.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.520
Tintin's sexy sister.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.720
You're back. Are you back?
I'm back like ballroom dancing.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.480
And I need your help,
my little...Fuckbob Shitpants.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.720
Right. Well, OK.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.840
I need you to hook me up
to a printer. I need a printer.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.400
All right. I wont do any blow-job
jokes if you don't, mate.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.000
Yeah. Copy that...mate.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.400
Just because somebody has
to kill people for a living
doesn't make them a killer.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.280
Do you know what I mean?
Not hugely, Malcolm, no.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.120
Anyway, what's the story, fuckanory?
What's been happening?

11:50.120 --> 11:53.120
Nothing much, really. Just...

11:53.120 --> 11:58.200
The only bit of turbulence is this
job Nicola's thinking of taking.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.200
Yale, apparently. The key people?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.240
No, the university.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.560
There's a think-tank there
that's approached her.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.840
I don't think that would be
a good idea. Do you?

12:08.840 --> 12:11.040
Well, she seems pretty set on it.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.840
Do you think that would be
a good idea?

12:13.840 --> 12:17.720
I'll have a word with her.
Yeah, have a word with her. Yeah.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.320
So you're not going
to ask me how I'm getting on?

12:21.480 --> 12:25.480
Sorry, that's very rude. How are you
getting on, Malcolm? How are you?

12:25.480 --> 12:30.120
Well...good days and bad days. Right.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.920
Steve Fleming's...

12:32.920 --> 12:35.400
I don't, you know...

12:35.400 --> 12:37.720
The guy is...
I fucking despise the guy.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.320
I despise him as much
as fucking James May
presumably despises himself.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.480
I'm glad he's getting a fucking
death sentence in Nicholas' report.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.560
Ah, death sentence for Fleming?

12:49.560 --> 12:52.800
Yeah, that's...not something
that should be out there.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.680
No. No, no, no, no.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.720
I'll catch you later. Thanks for
doing that. Not a problem, Malcolm.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.400
I'm very grateful...

13:02.480 --> 13:05.480
Malcolm's back.
Malcolm's back. He's through there.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.120
What? I'll call you back.
Hi. Hello.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.760
Are you alright? You've got that
cock in the cookie jar look.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.160
He's back. Who? Barrymore?
No. Clement Attlee?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.480
Oh, fuck! Yes. Malcolm. Yes.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.360
Oh, no. God, he's going to kill me.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.960
I was there when he was being sacked

13:18.360 --> 13:21.960
and he asked me for help

13:21.960 --> 13:24.760
and I held out and now he's going to

13:21.960 --> 13:24.760
want revenge, isn't he? Fuck!

13:24.760 --> 13:26.000
It's going to be like...

13:26.000 --> 13:29.360
Kill Bill or Get Carter, only it's
going to be Get And Kill Nicola

13:29.360 --> 13:33.440
And Then Get Carter And Bill
To Fucking Kill Her Too.
How did you hear about it?

13:33.440 --> 13:36.560
I've just connected his computer
for him in the old liaison...

13:36.560 --> 13:38.600
Fuck! He's in the building? Shit!
Where?

13:38.600 --> 13:41.520
He's in the old liaison office.
But he's in an odd way, Nicola.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.240
It's like he's been to the vet
and had his knacker's done.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.400
When I come back from Cabinet,
I'm going to hide in my office.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.040
For the rest of the day.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.280
Oh, God. I'm going to be glad
to be out here.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.040
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.920
Are you... All right. America?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.760
What are you thinking, Yale or nale?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.760
I don't know.

13:57.760 --> 14:03.480
Off the record, what do you think?
I really, really wonder whether
it's the right thing for you.

14:03.480 --> 14:08.720
I mean, it's a huge country,

14:03.480 --> 14:08.720
isn't it? I was going to live there.

14:03.480 --> 14:08.720
I wasn't going to eat it.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.160
I know, but imagine sitting there
on your fanny,

14:12.160 --> 14:15.280
watching King Of Queen's,
eating a Twinkie, and...

14:15.280 --> 14:18.560
Malcolm's told you to warn me
off it, hasn't he? No. Well, yeah.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.280
He's been here
two minutes and already

14:21.280 --> 14:25.040
he's pulling the strings of his
pathetic little voodoo marionette.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.760
No. Right. Fuck it.
I'm not going to hide.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.520
Bring it on!

14:30.520 --> 14:32.600
Malcolm.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.920
Hey, Nicola! How are you doing?

14:34.920 --> 14:39.040
You're back. Yeah, I'm just, um...
tying up a few loose ends.

14:39.040 --> 14:43.040
With which you're going to plait
some kind of garrotte
and strangle me.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.960
Forgive and forget.
That's my motto.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.640
I thought your motto was
"Who Fucks, Wins"

14:48.640 --> 14:51.520
or "Honi Soit Qui Malky Fuck."

14:51.520 --> 14:54.400
I've got a lot of mottos.
Don't take that job, Nicola.

14:54.400 --> 15:01.640
God, Malcolm... The anti-Tom brigade

14:54.400 --> 15:01.640
are just waiting for

14:54.400 --> 15:01.640
the first piece to fall.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.320
If you resign,
it's political fucking Jenga.

15:05.320 --> 15:09.800
You'll cause a landslide
that will bury this Government,

15:09.800 --> 15:11.920
and you'll keep the Party
in opposition

15:11.920 --> 15:16.520
until Daniel Radcliffe is
advertising walk-in baths in
the fucking People's Friend.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.680
I've got to go to Number Ten.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.200
I'll chum you over... chum.

15:26.480 --> 15:30.080
The rain in Spain stays mainly
on the plain.

15:30.080 --> 15:34.440
Well, actually, that is a popular
misconception, because what happens

15:34.440 --> 15:37.040
is the rain falls just before
the mountain ridge.

15:37.040 --> 15:43.400
They wouldn't want you to know that
because it would spoil the rhyme.
Julius... What's up, Boo-Boo?

15:44.960 --> 15:49.840
Not much. I'm just feeding some
vittles to these poor old ducks.

15:49.840 --> 15:56.080
That red-crested pochard there is
positively hoggish for this Hovis.

15:56.080 --> 16:01.840
I heard certain rumblings that
I don't come out terribly well
in this report of yours.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.360
Off the record, matey, am I fucked?

16:05.360 --> 16:12.600
Off the record, and this is
strictly between you, me and that
ornamental gatepost over there...

16:12.600 --> 16:16.280
Of course. ..the report is strictly
confidential until publication.

16:16.280 --> 16:20.520
Do you see what I've done there?
The bald man has done a funny.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.400
It's not funny, no.
It's not funny at all, Julius.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.120
I think I'm on sparkling form.
For fuck's sake. You fucking...

16:27.120 --> 16:30.760
Stephen! Pontius Pilate,
with the emphasis on ponce!

16:30.760 --> 16:36.240
"Care to do another draft, Sir
Whitewash?" What has the Mirror got?
"Give us the bald facts?"

16:36.240 --> 16:41.680
Oh. It's very rude, that, isn't it?
I was always taught never to make
personal remarks, but...

16:41.680 --> 16:47.080
He's impressive, Malcolm, in an evil
way. Like those women at Crufts who
make dogs dance on their hind legs.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.800
How are we all this morning?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.800
Bright and breezy or shite
and wheezy? Morning, Malcolm.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.960
Oh, that's a nice, snuggly fleece.
Going to the garden centre,
Malcolm?

16:55.960 --> 16:58.960
No, this is lovely and warm. 40 tog.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.160
Tell you what, I'm going
to make a cup of tea.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.280
Terri? No, Malcolm, honestly, no.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.680
You don't have to.
I can make the tea. Hey, Nicola!

17:05.680 --> 17:07.520
Do you want a... cup of tea?

17:07.520 --> 17:10.480
OK... Well, what do you want?

17:10.480 --> 17:12.839
Um, lemon zinger, please.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.480
A what? Lemon zinger.

17:14.480 --> 17:19.079
Whatever the lady wants. Is there
a kitty for this? Honestly,
Malcolm... Tenner enough?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.800
Take the money, woman, come on!

17:20.800 --> 17:24.720
Thank you very much. Hey, Malcolm?

17:24.720 --> 17:27.319
Yes? Bad luck on Steve, eh?

17:27.319 --> 17:30.800
Being long-lensed in the park
like that with Nicholson, hey, Malc?

17:30.800 --> 17:35.280
Nice double whammy, isn't it?
Fleming looks like he's trying
to influence the report

17:35.280 --> 17:38.280
AND do some bald-on-bald cottaging
at the same time.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.280
All that dark arts and spinning,
That's yester-Malcolm.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.600
That's not, you know, that's not
me any more. I like the new me.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.520
I feel 20 years younger.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.120
You look it.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.120
You look 20 years younger. Do I? Mm.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.240
You're looking great yourself,
you know, at the moment.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.160
That colour really, really suits
you. It's very, very attractive.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.560
Christ, is he dying or something?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.320
I don't know. (Is he flirting?)

18:01.880 --> 18:03.520
You... Julius.

18:03.520 --> 18:08.280
..are a naughty bastard.
Best thing I've read all year.
It's the only thing, mind you.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.000
You've done some awful things to me,
but this takes the bloody biscuit.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.960
And you've pissed on that biscuit
and I've got to eat it. Well,
I will not eat the pissy biscuit!

18:16.960 --> 18:19.320
Sam, no pissy biscuits!

18:19.320 --> 18:21.360
What are you going on about, Julius?

18:21.360 --> 18:24.800
You made it look as if Steve leant
on me so I'd wrongly exonerate him.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.600
As a result, I had to come down
upon him like a ton of bricks,

18:28.600 --> 18:32.880
totally unfairly, just to protect
my unimpeachable reputation
for fairness.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.960
Yeah, well, it's a great report.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.520
What I really like about it
is it's fucking short.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.600
How long did it take you to rewrite
the Steve Fleming stuff?

18:40.600 --> 18:44.720
I pulled an all-nighter. Black
coffee. Vivaldi on the iPod Touch.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.880
Certainly worth it. I mean,
he comes over as a 28-carat shite.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.080
Oh, Steve, mate.
Have you seen the papers?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
Looks like you're becoming the story.

18:54.080 --> 18:58.000
Stephen, can I... Oh, I understand,
Julius. It's the game we play.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.800
You did what you had to do.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.720
If it's all the same, Stephen...

19:02.720 --> 19:05.800
Steve! I'm sorry.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.560
I'll not forget this.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.760
Are you off to clear
your desk, Steve?

19:13.760 --> 19:16.080
Don't forget your lucky gonk,

19:16.080 --> 19:18.920
and your World's Shittest Dad mug.

19:18.920 --> 19:23.160
We were on the same side,
Malcolm, and you fucked me over!

19:23.160 --> 19:25.360
Not me, Stevo, not me.
The independent report.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.480
So I'm sorry,
but you're going to have to go.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.640
Oh, I agree with you. I'm going.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.120
I'm going to resign
from the Cabinet.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.600
And then I'm going to go
and join Dan Miller's team.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.480
I think we need a new leader.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.320
Steve! Oh, no, no, no. Steve!

19:43.320 --> 19:47.000
Don't you ever take up fucking poker,
because you're a crap liar.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.520
I am going to join Dan Miller's
team and then we are going
to take you down.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.760
We are going to take you down
to funky town!

19:54.760 --> 20:00.240
Funky town centre, here you come!
Choo fucking choo. Is this what
you're threatening me with?

20:00.240 --> 20:03.880
Fucking disco lights and
a fucking choo-choo train?

20:03.880 --> 20:05.480
You're a joke, Steve.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.160
There's nothing you can do! Steve!

20:08.160 --> 20:10.760
Yeah? There's one thing I can do.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.360
What are you going to do?
Yeah, wouldn't you like to know?

20:14.360 --> 20:18.400
Who are you going to meet?
Who's your meeting with? Bye-bye!

20:18.400 --> 20:21.000
I'm not fucking worried, mate!

20:21.000 --> 20:24.080
Fuck him, fuck him,
fuck him, fuck him!

20:24.080 --> 20:26.840
OK, listen, everybody.
That was Gavin at Number Ten.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.560
He reckons that Steve Fleming
has just joined the cabal.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.680
A complete disaster. There'll be
nothing else on television for weeks.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.080
Where's Malcolm?
The dark knight in all this.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.680
Malcolm will have grabbed his false
passport and got a plane to Brazil

20:40.680 --> 20:44.080
to spend the rest of his days
being the world's scariest dentist.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.480
Derek! Get the fuck down to ITN
right now and start briefing the shit
out of them. Where's Sarah?

20:48.480 --> 20:53.240
I want Sarah to do the cars.
I want her to pimp
the ministerial rides. Come on!

20:53.240 --> 20:56.600
Fire up the mid-range saloons.
Nicola Murray, just the girl!

20:56.600 --> 20:58.200
What the hell is going on here?

20:58.200 --> 21:02.280
In 20 minutes' time,
the Prime Minister of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland

21:02.280 --> 21:05.800
is going to announce
that he's calling the election.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.760
Shitting Henry!

21:07.760 --> 21:09.960
Thank you very much. OK, how...

21:09.960 --> 21:14.840
What I don't... How are you

21:09.960 --> 21:14.840
announcing... The Cabinet haven't...

21:09.960 --> 21:14.840
We haven't actually had...

21:14.840 --> 21:16.600
So how...? Wh, wh, wh...

21:16.600 --> 21:20.320
Exactly, exactly, exactly, Nicola!
See that, that fucking gibbering?

21:20.320 --> 21:24.840
That's what everyone
is doing now, the fucking cabal,
the fucking opposition, fucking us!

21:24.840 --> 21:28.240
We have grabbed the initiative.
Yeah, for maybe five minutes.

21:28.240 --> 21:33.440
Well, life is just a succession
of five minuteses! Oh, great.
So you're Buddha, now, are you?

21:33.440 --> 21:35.680
Yeah, if Buddha had been
on the cover of GQ.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.880
Yeah, could you get me the Yale
Centre For Economic Renewal, please?

21:39.880 --> 21:42.360
Why are you ringing them? Stay.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.840
Stay. No, look. Please don't ring...!
Don't fucking ring her.

21:45.840 --> 21:50.400
Hello? Relax. You've got plenty of
time. It's not ringing. Loads of...
Oh, it is ringing.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.920
It's time to tell the Yanks
to fuck off. Come on.

21:52.920 --> 21:57.560
Going leafleting in Neasden, yeah?
You have no right to do this.
I'll not be bounced by you.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.400
Listen, if you quit now, you might
well cost us this election, right?

22:01.400 --> 22:05.840
Bollocks. But see if we win,
there will be rewards.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.320
You've seen the Foreign Office.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.200
It's fucking huge, isn't it?

22:15.880 --> 22:19.040
Don't make me do this. Stay.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.720
OK, I'll stay.

22:20.720 --> 22:25.760
Hello, yes, sorry, I'd just like to
put you on to our mutual
acquaintance, Nicola Murray.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.280
She's got something she wants
to tell you. Hannah... Um...

22:30.280 --> 22:34.280
There's nobody there. Yeah, I spoke
to her already. You fucker!

22:34.280 --> 22:38.440
I'm going to put a word in for you
about the Foreign Office job.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.640
They're always looking for cleaners
there. You fucker, Malcolm!

22:41.640 --> 22:45.040
All right, then! Listen up,
my Children of a Lesser God.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.280
You'll find a file marked
"Snap Election Drill" on the J
drive.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.120
If you don't know how to access
the J drive, hand your pass in
at reception,

22:53.120 --> 22:58.760
go and buy some silver body paint
and pretend to be a robot on the
South Bank. Fly, my pretties, fly!

22:58.760 --> 23:01.720
Stuart! Stuart?
The Fucker's downstairs. No, no, no.

23:01.720 --> 23:06.760
He's not downstairs, but if he were,
I'd know about it and if I knew
about it, I would have vetoed it.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.360
He is, and he is complete poison.
Ah, The Fucker!

23:09.360 --> 23:14.840
And you thought he was just a myth
created to frighten naughty MPs into
eating all their truffles and swan.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.320
Watch my lips.
Cal Richard is not here.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.880
Cal! Hello.

23:19.880 --> 23:24.240
Hi. Hi, Stuart. Good to see you.
I didn't know about this.
JB didn't say anything.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.640
I just wanted it to be a surprise.
Yeah, why are you here?

23:27.640 --> 23:32.200
Well, I thought I'd just check in
with the intellectual powerhouse
of the party. Emma.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.040
If you want to step in the office,
I'll dismiss the children
and we can talk.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.840
No. Because I'm kidding, aren't I?

23:37.840 --> 23:43.680
No, because... I've come here to
tell you that you're fucking sacked.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.440
Halle-bloody-lujah!

23:45.440 --> 23:48.920
Shall I escort Stuart
from the building?
Don't be such a fucking turncoat.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.560
Excellent idea. While you're there,
could you do me another favour?

23:52.560 --> 23:58.360
Could you find a hostel,
go there and take a fucking
overdose of barbiturates?

23:59.480 --> 24:01.480
Yeah, right.
OK, well, I'm not fired.

24:01.480 --> 24:05.280
You can't fire me, Cal, so shall we
just cut to the chase? Hmm?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.880
"Ah, you can't fire me,
Cal, cos you're..."

24:07.880 --> 24:10.800
Gotcha. I'm kidding.
Of course you're not fired.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.040
Look at your face.

24:13.040 --> 24:17.920
Funny. I'm sensing a change of
management styles here, from
touchy-feely to smashy-testes.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.720
No, OK, joking aside.
I'm just an impartial observer.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.280
Quite partial, obviously, so...
Take it away, Captain Mainwaring.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.240
All right, folks. Listen up.

24:27.240 --> 24:31.400
We have three key targets when we
are smart-bombing our beloved PM,

24:31.400 --> 24:35.360
and they are the deficit,
unemployment, lack of leadership.

24:35.360 --> 24:40.400
Get on to the J drive.
You'll find key...
Fuck, that is brilliant!

24:40.400 --> 24:42.840
That is inspired! What sauce!

24:42.840 --> 24:44.960
Get in!

24:44.960 --> 24:49.720
It's the economy, Stu-pot!

24:49.720 --> 24:57.320
Fuck, what I really need to do
is shoot you all in the back of
the head! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

24:57.320 --> 25:01.280
But I can't, because it's illegal!

25:01.280 --> 25:06.320
OK, I'd like a small cappuccino,
two extra shots, please.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.480
I think we've got a long night
ahead of us.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.960
Come on! I'm coming.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.960
Better the devil you know, huh?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.360
Five years.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.280
I can't work the coffee machine.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.960
Fantastic news, isn't it?

25:22.960 --> 25:25.720
Yep, I'm going back to be
much freer. Two free weeks.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.360
So... did I miss anything?

25:27.360 --> 25:30.000
Glenn won a pound
on the scratchcard.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.840
That's my retirement sorted!

25:32.840 --> 25:36.040
So, we get out there
and hust, do we?

25:36.040 --> 25:41.680
Hmm? Hust. We go to the hustings.
Don't think it's a verb, is it,
Glenn? Well, all right, um...

25:41.680 --> 25:44.240
Could you do me a huge favour? 
Mmm-hmm.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.800
Could you just not talk for a second?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.600
OK.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.000
I think we're just playing it
in the wrong key.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.520
It's when we go,
"Red and yellow and blue..."

25:56.520 --> 26:01.200
What's she talking about? She's
putting on her annual production
of Joseph in Hemel Hempstead.

26:01.200 --> 26:06.720
She doesn't licence it ever
because she considers Joseph
to be public domain.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.080
But I need to just pitch it
a little higher.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.200
More like, "Red and yellow and..."

26:11.200 --> 26:17.720
She's directing it. And starring.
As Jacob. With a beard?

26:17.720 --> 26:21.920
One assumes so. Or she'll let
herself go for a couple of weeks,
see what happens.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.120
I know what people say
to you, right? They say,

26:25.120 --> 26:28.920
"We hate you."

26:25.120 --> 26:28.920
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.640
Everybody hates you.

26:30.640 --> 26:34.320
So fucking what? Some people,
they just fucking love to hate.

26:34.320 --> 26:38.360
Some people, they'd fucking walk
around the fucking Garden of Eden

26:38.360 --> 26:41.560
fucking moaning about the lack
of fucking mobile reception.

26:41.560 --> 26:47.080
These are the kind of fucks
who watched Mandela,
fucking Nelson Mandela...

26:47.080 --> 26:52.160
..walk to freedom,
and said, "Is Diagnosis Murder
not on the other side?"

26:52.160 --> 26:54.120
So we fucking forget about them.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.880
This Government's run this country
into the ground.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.800
This used to be a green
and pleasant land.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.000
Now it's the colour
of the fucking BBC weather map.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.840
It looks like anaemic dogshit.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.480
JB, Cal Richards,

27:09.480 --> 27:14.000
and their hordes
of fucking robots.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.320
They're coming over the hill towards
us and all you've got to do is this.

27:18.320 --> 27:23.360
Bend down, pick up any
fucking weapon you can
and twat the fuckery out of them.

27:23.360 --> 27:27.880
This Government is maimed,
but it can't be shamed.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.080
It will be fucked.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.400
Let's get out there
and let's fucking kill them.

27:33.400 --> 27:38.560
Let's set fire to tiers.
Let's go! Come on! Let's go, yes!

27:38.560 --> 27:41.120
OK, let's get going.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.240
What do we do?

27:43.240 --> 27:46.960
What do I call for an outside line?
It was great, wasn't it?
What do we do?

27:46.960 --> 27:49.480
Is it nine? That's what it is
everywhere else.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.520
Car's here. Car's here, Nicola.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.920
We're off.
Bye-bye Terri, then. See you soon.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.840
Just want to say goodbye.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.880
Sorry, very sticky, but...
Sorry, I scratched you.

27:59.880 --> 28:04.160
Honestly, I just want to say,
honestly... I mean it.

28:04.160 --> 28:07.360
Thank you. And yeah.
Thanks for the...stuff.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.560
Glenn, I don't know about you...
Don't worry about me, Terri.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.600
I've got plenty of options.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.200
I'm just going to take stock.
From Morrisons?

28:15.200 --> 28:18.400
OK, you can pick some records
as well. Girls Aloud.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.000
Or would that make it too seedy?
OK, Girls Aloud.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.520
Stop saying Abingdon to me!

28:22.520 --> 28:24.680
I want a fucking chocolate biscuit!

28:24.680 --> 28:27.880
Booked him on another
breakfast show. Bryan and Rob. 

28:27.880 --> 28:33.200
Yeah, for the first time in
a decade, I can feel the old dog
twitching to life.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.920
"This election give me an erection!"

28:36.920 --> 28:39.080
The old dog I was referring to
was me.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.160
See you, Nicola!

28:47.840 --> 28:49.360
Or not.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.520
