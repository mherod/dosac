WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.800
This programme contains
very strong language.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.840
I'm the Minister
for fucking Social Affairs.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.440
Hugh Abbott. Problems?

00:10.440 --> 00:13.560
Terri, explain that I'm the reason
they're here.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.960
So sorry about that.
That's all right.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.560
Amazing place. Welcome back.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.840
Thank you. Welcome back to you too.
It's ironic - were both back
on the same day.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.880
Although your reasons
for being away were rather more...

00:24.880 --> 00:27.600
important than my frivolous holiday.
No...

00:27.600 --> 00:30.640
It was fantastic though.
You can't go wrong with Italy.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.159
But how are you?

00:32.159 --> 00:35.160
Really upset,
actually, and sad about it.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.720
That your father had died...
Cos my father had died.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.360
Yup. Anyway, shall we...?

00:40.360 --> 00:42.280
We're upstairs.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.360
..get a bit of a wiggle on, yes.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.440
So, this is like a sort of
governing mall.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.280
There's actually a few problems.

00:49.280 --> 00:55.400
The e-mail system isn't working and
then the intelligent ventilation...

00:55.400 --> 00:57.080
Intelligent ventilation?

00:57.080 --> 01:00.160
At the moment we've got a wind
tunnel in the asylum directorate.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.680
Oh, no. Don't let any of
those out as diary stories.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.200
This is us.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.760
Right. Bit too
light and airy for my liking.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.560
Oh, and these are awful.
Do we have to have those?

01:09.560 --> 01:13.160
They look like Alicia's Barbie
furniture. Do you think they match?

01:13.160 --> 01:17.480
Not with that dress.
One of them'll have to go
and I'd rather it was the sofas.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.840
Oh, OK. Is this us?
Yes, this is actually you.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.600
Excuse me, isn't that
David Dickinson? Ooh, nice tan!

01:24.600 --> 01:28.120
I can't take all the credit,
cos the sun did most of the work.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.600
Not much privacy, is there?

01:30.600 --> 01:32.960
We'll be moving upstairs in a week.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.720
It's gonna be bloody hard to shoot
up in there. Yeah, that's true.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.960
It's just so pokey.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.160
Hugh, we're not gonna be here long.

01:41.160 --> 01:46.560
Hugh, Robyn's just given me
the date for your appearance before
the Education Select Committee -

01:46.560 --> 01:47.880
it's tomorrow.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.280
Oh, great(!) Oh, that is great.
Yes, welcome home, Hugh.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.440
Couldn't you have given me
something a bit more cushy

01:51.280 --> 01:55.440
for my first week back?

01:55.440 --> 01:58.720
A couple of lunches or a fact finder
to Dublin or something?

01:58.720 --> 02:02.320
That's the date they gave me. You
can't change select committee dates.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.160
So how did Liam get his changed
to go to the bloody Test Match?

02:06.160 --> 02:09.960
It's like sitting on a tea crate

02:06.160 --> 02:09.960
having chicken shit sprayed over me.

02:09.960 --> 02:14.040
I mean, why do we want to close down
schools for kids with special needs?

02:14.040 --> 02:19.000
It's the one thing that I really
do not want to do,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.160
and yet, bizarrely, I'm the person
intimately involved in doing it.

02:23.160 --> 02:28.520
Robyn, go and see IT about the
e-mail
problem, please. That'd be great.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.960
So now Terri's back, I just get
all the dull stuff, is that right?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.480
Pretty much, yes.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.440
Oh, right, well, of course.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.400
Well, I'll see you later.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.320
Glenn, the Special Needs Bill,
with your...

02:42.320 --> 02:44.680
particular interest,
I can't do this.

02:44.680 --> 02:49.000
You know my views - inclusion
is an illusion, it doesn't work.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.720
But you don't mind if I go ahead

02:49.000 --> 02:51.720
with it? Of course not.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.640
Look...you're only following orders.

02:54.640 --> 02:59.600
Oh, thanks. So you won't make me

02:54.640 --> 02:59.600
feel bad except by comparing me
to a concentration camp guard?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.040
No, right, yeah.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.440
Tomorrow, Select Committee,
that's Ballentine, isn't it?

03:05.440 --> 03:08.840
Who wants to go and watch
Bollock-Vision? What?

03:08.840 --> 03:12.480
Mr Malcolm Tucker turning it all
the way up to 11 in the lobby.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.960
The biggest problem we've got is guys
like you blabbing their mouth off.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.760
Poor Keith. Malcolm
must fucking love this place -

03:18.760 --> 03:20.640
four ministers in one building.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.040
It's his dream -
a one-stop bollock shop.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.760
We're gonna be getting
some of that in about an hour.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.160
You understand me? I don't know
what's worse - watching him slowly

03:25.760 --> 03:30.160
rumble towards you

03:30.160 --> 03:34.600
like prostate cancer or him
appearing suddenly out of nowhere
like a severe stroke.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.600
Oh. How's your sister coping?

03:39.800 --> 03:44.760
So, this new word "citizenship" -
did the PM actually
outline what it entails?

03:44.760 --> 03:49.040
I think he was making the reshuffle
up as he went along
and I think we were very lucky

03:49.040 --> 03:52.000
that citizenship was the first
word that sprang to mind.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.480
We could be the Department for
Social Affairs and Woodland Folk.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.560
Problem is though, Hugh,
that there's been a bit of a rush.

03:58.560 --> 04:04.160
With you not in place,
every department trying to unload
all the stuff they didn't want.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.520
It's been like someone driving
down Whitehall shouting,
"Bring out your shit!"

04:08.520 --> 04:11.440
and it's ended up at our door.
So what are we getting?

04:11.440 --> 04:15.440
Citizenship basically involves
cutting pensions to the Gurkhas,

04:15.440 --> 04:21.920
rejigging the protocols for rabies
outbreaks, some crap from Health

04:15.440 --> 04:21.920
about long-term care for the elderly

04:21.920 --> 04:25.080
that neither they nor we
have any real idea about...

04:25.080 --> 04:27.160
And everything to do
with the Isle of Man.

04:27.160 --> 04:31.200
Just what I fucking need -
five new ways to lose my job.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.120
Where did that come from?

04:34.120 --> 04:35.800
Malcolm sent that.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.560
It's far too big, why did he send
it? Office warming present.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.120
Why did he send us a present?
I don't know.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.840
Has security checked this?
What for, tiny little terrorists?

04:45.840 --> 04:48.640
Yes. It's a plant. Yes?!

04:48.640 --> 04:52.800
So, citizenshit - what we need
to do is knock together some nice,

04:52.800 --> 04:56.200
touchy-feely, fondly, sneaky,
hand-in-the-bra policies.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.400
New bicycles for special constables,
that sort of thing?

04:59.400 --> 05:05.000
Making special needs kids clean up
graffiti. That's just very mean.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.800
Well, yes. Not as mean as
making them spell graffiti,
that genuinely is very mean.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.680
I'll go and have
a word with Malcolm. OK.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.280
You just took a shit
with your clothes on, Ollie.

05:15.280 --> 05:22.240
Why? What...? Glenn's boy, Peter, he
went to a special needs school. Oh.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.840
Yeah.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.480
Glenn's had sex?

05:27.480 --> 05:30.280
God, you're such a prick, Ollie.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.280
It's just a joke...

05:30.280 --> 05:35.840
There's more to life than having
Nick Robinson's mobile number

05:30.280 --> 05:35.840
on your fucking Blackberry.

05:35.840 --> 05:42.080
All right, fine, sorry, Hugh. I

05:35.840 --> 05:42.080
feel for the guy. I had a girlfriend
with special needs once, so...

05:42.080 --> 05:44.680
Luckily, I was able to fulfil them.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.600
God, you're such a...

05:46.600 --> 05:48.960
Haircut? Chemo. (Knob.)

05:48.960 --> 05:52.159
Did you enjoy the show?

05:48.960 --> 05:52.159
You were magnificent, darling.

05:52.159 --> 05:55.640
Should I phone Keith so that his

05:52.159 --> 05:55.640
team can watch you bollock me now?

05:55.640 --> 05:59.159
No, no. Have I got
my bollocking face on? Well...

05:59.159 --> 06:01.240
No, this is my bollocking face.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.760
Ooh, crikey, yes. Thanks for
the pot plant, by the way.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.320
Did I send that?
As an office warming present.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.760
Christ, she's a great PA,
isn't she, Sam?

06:09.760 --> 06:12.320
She always remembers
the little people.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.960
Look at the size of that - you could
fucking crucify somebody on that.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.640
So, what do you think
of the new building, eh?

06:18.640 --> 06:23.360
I can't wait to move upstairs
because I don't really like
the glass walls on this floor.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.360
I just feel a bit exposed.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.440
Like a whore in a Reeperbahn window.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.720
Glenn, it's Ollie,
he wants you to go through and
clarify the citizenship brief.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.200
How much, love? Sorry?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.040
OK, I'm on it.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.760
Catch you later.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.920
I like the tan, by the way.
Thank you. Have you declared it?

06:41.920 --> 06:46.920
Staying at the villa of an

06:41.920 --> 06:46.920
influential friend? I haven't got any
influential friends, Malcolm.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.760
You are my only influential friend.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.280
And I'm not really your friend.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.880
You're not really my friend.
So, this Super Schools Bill...

06:55.400 --> 06:57.840
You don't think it's so super,
do you?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.440
You're doing it now.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.040
What?

07:01.040 --> 07:03.040
That's your bollocking face.

07:03.040 --> 07:07.360
You know, it's great you get
all misty-eyed over Glenn's kid,

07:07.360 --> 07:11.280
but no-one's trying to fuck over
special needs kids.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.800
Wh...Really?

07:12.800 --> 07:16.240
Before I went away, I consulted
an expert, Mark Ryan, and he...

07:16.240 --> 07:20.760
The LSE education guy? What did that
sandal-wearing nonce have to say?

07:20.760 --> 07:23.400
He said that closing down
special needs schools

07:23.400 --> 07:26.960
and putting needy kids into
mainstream education
is a lousy idea.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.160
But I've got an expert
who will deny that.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.680
And SEN parents
want the special schools kept open.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.280
Yeah, well, my expert would
totally oppose that.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.760
Who is your expert? I've no idea,

07:36.280 --> 07:39.760
but I can get one by this afternoon.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.680
You have spoken to the wrong expert,
you've gotta ask the right expert.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.080
And you've gotta know what
an expert's gonna advise you
before he advises you.

07:48.080 --> 07:52.280
Hugh, whether you like this or not,
you are gonna have to promote
this bill,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.800
so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna
get you another expert, yeah?

07:55.800 --> 07:56.920
OK.

07:56.920 --> 08:04.280
Surely, Mr Smedley,

07:56.920 --> 08:04.280
inclusion has been shown to fail
the most vulnerable SEN children?

08:04.280 --> 08:09.280
When inclusion's done badly,
yes, you're gonna get bad results,
that's a given.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.960
Inclusion is an illusion.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.920
Mark Ryan from the LSE was saying
that when the special schools
do get it right,

08:15.920 --> 08:20.000
that the parents of SEN children
absolutely fucking flock to...

08:20.000 --> 08:23.360
You spoke to Mark Ryan? Yeah,
I was taking expert advice, so...

08:23.360 --> 08:27.240
Expert advice from Mark Ryan? Yeah.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.240
You have a problem with Mark Ryan?

08:27.240 --> 08:31.400
In educational circles, he's a bit
of a joke. That's another given.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.600
Is it?

08:31.400 --> 08:34.600
NEW MAIL ARRIVES

08:31.400 --> 08:34.600
Sorry.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.919
It's just that I'm expecting
something quite important.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.799
Is our e-mail up and running? No.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.120
No, no, this is my Hotmail.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.400
Sorry, can you excuse me just...?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.040
We live in an inclusive society,
am I right?

08:53.040 --> 09:00.960
Indeed. So let's not let the
Mark Ryans of this world create

08:53.040 --> 09:00.960
an ability apartheid for children.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.520
The alternative is to isolate
these kids in ghetto schools.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.520
The minister won't be a moment.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.480
OLLIE: Good spot for a suicide, this.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.560
Good, long drop,
appreciative audience.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.360
What if you just broke your back?

09:13.360 --> 09:16.240
You'd be paralysed for life
and you'd still be depressed

09:16.240 --> 09:19.200
about the thing that was
depressing you in the first place.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.640
What are these hangy-down things?

09:21.640 --> 09:24.640
They're acoustic baffles,

09:21.640 --> 09:24.640
they stop it getting too echoey.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.000
So when you break your back,
nobody can hear you screaming?

09:28.000 --> 09:33.120
That is the kind
of attention to detail
that you get in a PFI building.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.520
MALCOLM: Hey!
Get back to work, all of you!

09:37.960 --> 09:42.320
I'm off to Number 10 for this
Cabinet summit with the PM
and wonky Ron from education,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.760
try and swing this
Special Needs Bill around.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.200
If it drags on,
can you phone home and tell Kate?

09:47.200 --> 09:51.440
Cos she doesn't watch rolling news,
because...well,
she's a normal human being.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.320
Yes, Massa, I's a good slave.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.320
Can I just say...?

09:54.320 --> 09:58.000
Something absolutely,
cataclysmically bad has happened.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.920
Whoa, slow down, what's going on?

09:59.920 --> 10:04.240
I've just had a phone call
from a man, he's got a child,
he lives in Reigate. Gosh.

10:04.240 --> 10:10.240
This child, she is called Glenn
after Glenn Close
and her surname is Cullen.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.120
She's Glenn Cullen. And this
morning, apparently, in her in...

10:15.640 --> 10:18.120
In the e-mail tray,

10:18.120 --> 10:21.720
she got a note
and it used these words, "Christ"

10:21.720 --> 10:23.520
and "cunt"

10:23.520 --> 10:26.600
and apparently, I sent it. No!

10:26.600 --> 10:29.120
Anybody could use that computer.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.000
Hugh, Glenn says could you
head over? Yes, I must go.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.760
Ollie was using it earlier.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.400
You were using my computer.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.600
Did you send an e-mail this morning
about me, calling me a cunt?

10:39.600 --> 10:43.680
No, no, I never use that word.
No, absolutely, I won't use it

10:43.680 --> 10:49.200
until it's been fully normalised
and has no further association

10:43.680 --> 10:49.200
with the female twat.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.640
It was you!

10:49.200 --> 10:51.640
We'll get to the bottom of this.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.240
I've got to go to Number 10, but I
absolutely give you my word. Good.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.520
Look.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.120
No, I didn't get any e-mail
about Roy Smedley.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.760
Was it funny? Kind of.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.480
It was a bit sweary.

11:05.480 --> 11:11.480
Look, at least he served his
purpose - we've now got some very
useful material to trot out in case

11:11.480 --> 11:17.360
my bloody Ballentine wants to know
why you've done a big U-turn
and are now in favour of inclusion.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.840
I haven't! I'm taking a fucking
stand on this one, I'm buggered

11:17.360 --> 11:21.840
if I'm gonna let you down.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.880
I'm gonna tell the PM straight up,
this bill is a load of old bollocks.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.000
No, you're not. No, but it'd be
great if I did, wouldn't it?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.880
Another little bit of my soul
chipped away. Don't worry about it.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.520
No, no, she's very religious...
I never once heard her swear.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.240
Hugh, the Guardian website
has broken the e-mail thing.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.400
The final edition
here of the Standard.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.960
I am suddenly a major news story.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.120
Sweary Woman Of Whitehall.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.040
It's a pun, isn't it? It's not
really punning on anything, is it?

11:55.040 --> 11:58.520
Not funny. How do you appear out of
nowhere in a building made of glass?

11:58.520 --> 12:01.840
I'm a shape shifter.
Look, get this fucking sorted out.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.160
You're not having a nervous
breakdown or something, are you?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.640
Get on top of it, OK?
You will see me again.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.520
Hugh, I don't want to be the story.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.520
The Sun are running a cartoon with
you being arrested by a cunt-stable.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.000
Don't be such a bastard. Whoa there,
turd-tonsils, we don't want any...

12:20.000 --> 12:23.480
Hey, that's quite enough of that,
just knock it off, OK?

12:23.480 --> 12:25.240
Terri, come here.

12:26.320 --> 12:31.480
Just fucking pull yourself together
and act your age, we've had
enough of your puerile influence.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.280
Actually, Hugh, I think I might
have an idea about...

12:34.280 --> 12:38.720
Just... Just tell me, truthfully -

12:38.720 --> 12:40.960
did you send that e-mail?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.640
No, I didn't.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.080
And you KNOW I didn't.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.480
What? I'm sorry?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.320
Are you...are you inferring that...?
Implying.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.400
You're implying that...

12:57.400 --> 13:00.360
it was me who...?

13:00.360 --> 13:03.360
(I saw you, Hugh, I saw you do it.)

13:15.000 --> 13:19.520
It was for Glenn, for our Glenn,
you know, to amuse him when that

13:19.520 --> 13:23.000
prick man was in his office and I
just typed in the wrong address.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.920
It was a genuine mistake.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.000
I didn't really see you,
I was bluffing.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.320
That doesn't bode well for your
Select Committee performance.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.320
I knew you were bluffing.

13:33.320 --> 13:37.440
I admitted it
because it's the right thing to do,
not because you caught me out.

13:37.440 --> 13:43.720
And I caught you out,
cos you lied about seeing me do it.

13:37.440 --> 13:43.720
So, how do you like them apples?

13:43.720 --> 13:46.120
Are you going to admit to this
publicly?

13:46.120 --> 13:48.160
What?! No, are you mad?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.440
I can't do that.
That mustn't happen.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.320
You've got, I need you to, to...

13:53.320 --> 13:58.480
What, to lie? I think it was
Derrida who said there is no such
thing as actual, empirical truth...

13:58.480 --> 14:02.320
I'll tell you what Derrida said,
he said, "Go fuck your face, Abbot!"

14:02.320 --> 14:05.960
You need to mind your language, it
will keep getting you into trouble.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.000
Can't even get out of
the fucking room!

14:09.560 --> 14:13.680
Now to the meat
of the committee's interest.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.720
You've made quite a U-turn on
SEN schools, haven't you, Minister?

14:17.720 --> 14:19.920
Why have you sold out?

14:19.920 --> 14:22.920
Sold out, that's rather an emotive
way of putting it.

14:22.920 --> 14:27.040
You are on record as having been

14:22.920 --> 14:27.040
very much in opposition to inclusion.

14:27.040 --> 14:32.920
No, it's just that
times have changed and I have
reassessed...the landscape.

14:32.920 --> 14:39.080
We now have the funding for
new academies which will have
two behaviour support teachers,

14:39.080 --> 14:43.840
so these Super Schools
will offer skill clusters... Yes,
but we're not interested in that.

14:43.840 --> 14:48.680
What the committee
are rather curious about is
how it is you've changed your mind,

14:48.680 --> 14:53.680
given your absolute opposition
to this proposal in the past.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.240
Did you seek specialist advice
on the subject?

14:56.240 --> 14:58.600
Of course I sought expert advice.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.280
Yes, and who?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.000
Roy Smedley. And?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.200
And...he was very good.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.640
And his was the only advice you took?

15:11.640 --> 15:15.000
You saw only one expert?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.520
Yes.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.800
And you thought that was enough?

15:20.800 --> 15:24.560
Just one? I tried to find somebody
who said something different.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.400
And did you succeed? No. No-one?

15:27.400 --> 15:28.920
No.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.400
How was that?
I lied to the Select Committee.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.520
I lied. Is Tucker in the building?
Malcolm In The Middle. What?

15:37.520 --> 15:41.520
Because he can stand in the middle of
the atrium and shout at everyone.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.640
I don't want to see him.
I can't take one of his scenes
from the Exorcist now.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.480
Ballentine's not on to anything.

15:47.480 --> 15:52.760
Oh, no? Why did she keep asking,
"Just one expert, only one?"

15:52.760 --> 15:55.880
"Not two experts? Less than three
but not two?" Fucking bitch.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.080
She's trying to throw you off
balance, like a sumo wrestler.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.680
It worked. I was on the floor
in a big fucking nappy.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.840
Oh, shit, that's Malcolm.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.560
A man in his fifties hiding.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.920
He's gone. Look, Hugh, come out.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.680
Get it in perspective.
It's not like it's a major lie.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.600
It's not like you were selling
naval secrets down a gay club.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.440
Why does he never laugh with me
like that?

16:17.440 --> 16:18.480
Lack of click?

16:18.480 --> 16:21.960
HUSHED VOICE: I thought I was
a professional press officer.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.760
It just is absolute hell.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.440
Hi, how is the...?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.640
I'm actually in a bit of
a state here.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.400
It's just that something cropped up

16:30.640 --> 16:34.400
we need to talk about at the meeting

16:34.400 --> 16:37.240
and then you can get on with
what ever you, you know...

16:37.240 --> 16:39.560
Don't you think I'm due
a bit of support?

16:39.560 --> 16:43.440
Yes, I do, absolutely, it's just
that my committee thing is actually

16:43.440 --> 16:48.080
a bigger deal than your sweary
thing. It just is.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.320
Malcolm, good to see you.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.240
Were you hiding just now, Hugh? No.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.720
Right, Terri, you're gonna give
a press conference in 90 minutes.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.080
You're gonna apologise,
there's your statement, learn it.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.200
I organise the press conferences,
I don't give them, normally.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.200
OK, seeing as you're not used to
this, I'll go through it for you.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.160
At a press conference,
a bunch of press people appear,

17:10.160 --> 17:15.680
they're gonna have things called
cameras and microphones and
mobile phones and hangovers

17:15.680 --> 17:20.760
then you will walk out and you're
going to read from what we call
a prepared statement.

17:20.760 --> 17:26.599
You will say, "I'm really
fucking sorry for sounding like
a hairy-arsed docker after 12 pints,

17:26.599 --> 17:30.440
"I promise that I will never call
an eight-year-old girl a cunt again.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.400
"Can we just draw a line under this
and fucking move on? Thank you."

17:34.400 --> 17:36.760
Everybody goes home
and then we wait and see.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.960
You get to keep your job,
although you will forever be known as
The Sweary Woman Of Whitehall.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.200
OLLIE: This first Mark Ryan meeting

17:40.960 --> 17:44.200
would be in the diary.

17:44.200 --> 17:50.560
Do you want to see if we could
post that down the memory hole?

17:44.200 --> 17:50.560
Diaries do get lost, don't they?

17:50.560 --> 17:53.600
We've lost a few diaries
in our time, haven't we?

17:53.600 --> 17:56.960
Listen, do it subtly,
I don't wanna know about it.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.880
I mean, do it, but don't tell me.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.680
Do I know? Yeah. No. I don't know.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.800
Do I know? Don't... You sort it out.

18:03.800 --> 18:08.760
Do I know? Sort it out but don't
tell me you're sorting it out.

18:03.800 --> 18:08.760
There isn't a chain.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.160
I don't think you quite get it,
Malcolm. My life is in tatters,

18:12.160 --> 18:16.280
nobody will speak to me
at my daughter's school.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.280
Why should I lie for you?

18:16.280 --> 18:19.440
Because
it's your job to make him look good!

18:19.440 --> 18:22.280
What kind of a PR person are you?

18:22.280 --> 18:24.520
Look, are you...? Hey, hey, hey.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.600
Are you going to take a bad story
and make it worse?

18:27.600 --> 18:33.120
Say, "Hi, everyone, I know this looks

18:27.600 --> 18:33.120
bad but wait till you hear this!

18:33.120 --> 18:38.040
"It was actually the Minister
for Social Affairs and Citizenship
who called a small child a cunt.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.960
"So it really is very much
worse than we thought."

18:40.960 --> 18:45.640
IF you were to go out there
and tell the truth,

18:45.640 --> 18:47.880
it would be morally repugnant

18:47.880 --> 18:54.880
because what you'd be doing is
condemning a guy who's doing his
fucking best to make things better,

18:54.880 --> 18:57.960
you'd be condemning him
to the scrapheap.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.320
Right... OK?

19:00.320 --> 19:02.640
Yes. Good girl. Will you get Robyn?

19:02.640 --> 19:05.360
Robyn,
can you help her go over her lines?

19:05.360 --> 19:12.200
It was interesting watching you
talking about the truth et cetera,
cos I had a similar problem today.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.120
Really? Yeah, at the committee,

19:15.120 --> 19:18.920
I didn't, well, unwittingly
I didn't tell the entire truth.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.680
You lied? To Claire Ballentine?

19:20.680 --> 19:23.040
Yeah. Does she know?

19:23.040 --> 19:25.480
I don't think so -
she couldn't possibly know.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.400
Oh, well, it doesn't matter then.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.240
I lied to the Select Committee -
it's like lying to the House.

19:30.240 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, but if she doesn't know,
then it doesn't matter, Hugh.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.360
I really can't be
fielding calls right now,
I've got a lot of lines to learn.

19:38.360 --> 19:42.240
Claire Ballentine's office want
diaries from the last 12 weeks.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.280
Shit! She's on to us, why else would
she...? Have you got the diaries?

19:46.280 --> 19:49.080
Yes, in a sense.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.920
Ollie might be doing something with
the diaries that I don't officially

19:52.920 --> 19:55.040
know about because
he hasn't told me.

19:55.040 --> 19:59.360
Well, you'd better get him to undo
what you don't know he's doing.
I can't, I don't know he's doing it.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.640
Hugh,
go and get Ollie and Glenn in here.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.640
This is really serious,
you have lied to a Select Committee.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.160
I told you that.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.160
That's like lying to the House!

20:08.160 --> 20:10.720
That's what I said. Yeah, but
they're on to you! Yes...

20:10.720 --> 20:12.680
Jesus Christ!

20:12.680 --> 20:16.200
Malcolm, do you think this is
too bright? It's too bright!

20:16.200 --> 20:20.480
Can you, please, Robyn, go down
to the Sketchley concession
and get my grey suit, now.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.040
Do I look ten?

20:22.040 --> 20:26.640
Do I look like I'm on some
bloody...? Please, just do it,
get the suit.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.080
Can I have the money, please?
Don't you get paid?

20:29.080 --> 20:30.880
Have you got the diaries?

20:30.880 --> 20:35.920
Yes. I don't know. We shredded
some preliminary sections.
I don't wanna hear.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.800
Hugh, take your fingers
out your fucking ears.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.920
You're gonna go to the
Select Committee tomorrow
and apologise to them.

20:42.920 --> 20:48.720
I'll tell them I forgot.
They can't have me for that, it's
an involuntary thing, like farting.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.920
Malcolm!

20:50.920 --> 20:54.480
What?! Malcolm,
you're meant to be dealing with me!

20:54.480 --> 20:57.520
The worst that can happen
to you is you'll lose your job.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.240
I'm gonna lose my reputation.
Just grow up, Terri.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.440
YOU grow up.
I am a fucking grown up, thank you.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.800
You could have fooled me.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.400
Glenn's son could have fooled you.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.080
No offence, Glenn. I'm sorry.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.560
Will you two get this paper trail
sorted and get your story sorted out.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.320
Could you stop swearing, please?

21:13.320 --> 21:16.400
I'm really sorry, you won't hear
any more swearing from us,

21:16.400 --> 21:19.080
you massive, gay SHITE!

21:19.080 --> 21:20.920
Fuck off!

21:22.120 --> 21:26.360
Right. How are you doing in
sorting out whether he lied

21:22.120 --> 21:26.360
or not, everything OK?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.080
Pretty well, yeah. Is that a lie?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.760
Yeah. That is not
fucking funny, you retard.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.760
I'm sorry about that, Glenn,
the situation just...

21:33.760 --> 21:35.280
Here she comes.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.640
'Good afternoon.'
Christ, there's that fucking sofa.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.840
'I'd like to offer my sincere
and unreserved apologies

21:47.840 --> 21:51.400
'for the terrible outrage
caused by the e-mail I sent.'

21:51.400 --> 21:56.480
It was never meant
to be read by anybody other
than the intended recipient.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.880
'I...understand that the...'
Oh, for...

22:00.880 --> 22:02.400
What the hell's he...? Twat.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.640
Perhaps he doesn't realise he's
walking in front of the camera.

22:07.640 --> 22:11.040
'..to use language like that in an
internal departmental conversation

22:11.040 --> 22:13.280
'or any conversation.
"..any conversation."

22:13.280 --> 22:16.440
'I wish I had never sent
the e-mail...' What?

22:16.440 --> 22:19.600
'and indeed I find it hard
to believe that I did.'

22:19.600 --> 22:23.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa - she's gone off
script here. Fucking hell, Terri...

22:23.440 --> 22:28.400
'..a momentary lapse in restraint

22:28.400 --> 22:32.600
'and that...' OK, we're back
on track. Yeah, thank God.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.000
'..and I wish to apologise
that I have let down'

22:36.000 --> 22:37.640
the electorate,

22:37.640 --> 22:40.280
the Minister, my colleagues,

22:40.280 --> 22:42.520
'my own family...'

22:42.520 --> 22:44.360
Even though half of them are dead.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.800
'..and indeed the voters of

22:44.360 --> 22:47.800
the future...' "..Our children."

22:47.800 --> 22:50.000
'..our children.' Now get off.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.640
Yeah, brilliant, Malcolm, well done.
Fucking stunning.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.480
Well, done. Well, done.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.600
OK, we've got to get upstairs,
start rehearsing for tomorrow's

22:55.480 --> 22:59.600
select committee.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.800
Absolutely. I'm never going to get

22:59.600 --> 23:03.800
out of this fucking building, am I?

23:03.800 --> 23:07.400
D'you remember when I came down to
see Peter's concert at his school?

23:07.400 --> 23:12.480
His face,

23:07.400 --> 23:12.480
the pride he had when he played,
his face is etched in my memory.

23:12.480 --> 23:19.080
Yeah? Yeah. Fucking unbearable,
that's why I needed Malcolm's expert

23:12.480 --> 23:19.080
to try and wipe it from my mind.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.680
Hasn't really worked though.
Oh, Hugh, mate,
don't panic, you'll manage,

23:23.680 --> 23:27.360
just do what you have to do.
Whatever you have to do, you know,
do it.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.560
Just make sure that you don't
get sweat on your upper lip,

23:27.360 --> 23:31.560
makes you look guilty.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.840
What am I supposed to do?
I've no idea.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.160
But if you sweat it makes
your face look like spam.

23:37.160 --> 23:41.240
It has come to the Committee's notice
that, um, you did not see just one

23:41.240 --> 23:47.160
special advisor as you told us in
your previous appearance, but two.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.200
Why did you omit to
mention that fact?

23:49.200 --> 23:54.120
Yes, I, I apologise unreservedly

23:49.200 --> 23:54.120
for that oversight. I-I forgot.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.480
Are you forgetful generally?

23:56.480 --> 24:00.280
Well, it's, er, hard to know, um,
how forgetful one is because

24:00.280 --> 24:04.040
you'd have to remember all
the things that you'd remembered

24:04.040 --> 24:07.080
and all the things that you'd
forgotten in order to compare

24:07.080 --> 24:10.760
and how could I remember what I've
forgotten, cos I've forgotten it.

24:10.760 --> 24:15.360
I'm pretty good on the whole -
if I see a picture of the Queen,

24:10.760 --> 24:15.360
I can put a name to her face.

24:15.360 --> 24:20.680
And if I see a movie, I don't sit
there going "Oh, who's that one, is
that the cop or is that the pirate?"

24:20.680 --> 24:24.000
So you just accidentally
told a slight untruth.

24:24.000 --> 24:31.760
I...my statement was unintentionally
not a truthful statement, I-I-I
slightly misled the committee.

24:31.760 --> 24:36.200
You completely misled.
I misled the committee and I,
and I've apologised for that.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.520
Are you lying to me now
about not lying to me before?

24:38.520 --> 24:41.560
No, no, I am not a liar.

24:41.560 --> 24:46.880
I categorically did not knowingly
not tell the truth.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.520
Even though, unknowingly,
I might not have done.

24:50.520 --> 24:54.200
In fact, I wanted to come back
and apologise to the Committee.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.600
Very glad to be of service,
but you didn't want to come back to
this Committee, did you?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.360
You were told to come back.

25:00.360 --> 25:04.960
I am sure the last thing you wanted
to do was to come back given
how busy you have been recently.

25:04.960 --> 25:10.520
In fact, interestingly enough,
we do notice from your diaries

25:04.960 --> 25:10.520
that your meeting with Roy Smedley

25:10.520 --> 25:16.320
seems to have taken place at
almost exactly the same time as the
now notorious sweary e-mail was sent.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.240
I was in that meeting, so I couldn't
possibly have sent it.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.280
I wasn't suggesting...
it was your chief press officer.

25:22.280 --> 25:25.160
Yes, yes, it was,
and her father's just died, yep.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.920
I'm very sorry to hear that.
No-one was suggesting...

25:27.920 --> 25:31.280
No, and quite right too, but
you know what people are like.

25:31.280 --> 25:37.200
Going back to my initial concern, it
would now seem that the two meetings

25:37.200 --> 25:43.000
that you had with the two special
education advisors provided you
with two opposing verdicts.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.480
Yes. And yet you came up with one,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.480
so would it be therefore true to say

25:46.480 --> 25:51.000
that the government is intent
on pushing this through,
regardless of what anyone says?

25:51.000 --> 25:56.160
No. We wanted two opinions
because we wanted to start a debate.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.360
Not much of a debate if you ignore
one and just go with the other.

25:59.360 --> 26:04.560
It's a personal thing,
but if government isn't personal,
then what the hell is it?

26:04.560 --> 26:10.320
My senior advisor
Glenn Cullen has a son,

26:10.320 --> 26:15.160
his name is Peter and he has
special educational needs.

26:15.160 --> 26:19.080
Glenn obviously wouldn't
say anything about it,
he's far too professional.

26:19.080 --> 26:25.600
But I had the privilege
of going down with Glenn

26:19.080 --> 26:25.600
to Peter's SEN school

26:25.600 --> 26:30.600
and watched Peter playing

26:25.600 --> 26:30.600
the trombone in the school orchestra.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.480
It wasn't very good...

26:33.480 --> 26:36.800
um...struggled manfully,

26:36.800 --> 26:40.560
and Glenn leaned over to me
and he said,

26:40.560 --> 26:43.760
"If only this was a Super School,

26:43.760 --> 26:47.120
"inclusion is not an illusion".

26:47.120 --> 26:49.040
And, er...

26:49.040 --> 26:51.640
I think that tipped
the balance for me.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.160
It's a personal thing.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.400
Look, say something.
Well, what is to say?

27:06.400 --> 27:10.320
I can't believe you did that.
You were the one who said
do what you have to do.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.360
I understand that and I know

27:10.320 --> 27:14.360
nothing is sacred but I didn't mean
for you to do that.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.040
Then why were you...
were you misleading me?

27:14.360 --> 27:18.040
Oh, don't give me that bollocks.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.800
Look, I'm sorry, OK?
I'm really sorry.

27:21.800 --> 27:26.440
D'you know, I wish I'd kept
Peter's trombone because if I had,

27:26.440 --> 27:29.480
I would shove it up your arse
right now, wide end first.

27:29.480 --> 27:34.000
Listen, you're the best senior
advisor anybody could want and...

27:34.000 --> 27:36.080
Come on, you're my best pal. OK.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.600
So are you...? Am I...?

27:44.480 --> 27:46.560
Hello. You all right?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.160
Very strong performance,
by the way, the apology.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.880
You think you can get around me
with compliments now?

27:53.880 --> 27:56.880
I'm not your favourite chocolate in
the box, I just wanted to say

27:56.880 --> 28:01.960
I appreciate everything and
whatever happens, I will fight for
you, irrespective of what you did.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.880
What I did?

28:03.880 --> 28:06.880
I didn't do it Hugh, d'you remember?
You sent the e-mail.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.440
I'm sorry, I forgot. Forgot?!

28:08.440 --> 28:12.280
No, I just can't get anything right,
I'm going to shut my mouth
and go away.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.640
Hugh, go to the gents, please,

28:13.640 --> 28:19.880
look at the man who's standing in

28:13.640 --> 28:19.880
front of you in the mirror and say,
"Can I live with him, can I?"

28:19.880 --> 28:22.280
You're in there.
What else can go wrong?

28:22.280 --> 28:25.600
Unless the energy system sets fire
to my office and puts it out

28:25.600 --> 28:28.280
by squirting human shit
through the sprinklers.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.640
Malcolm's coming this way. Oh, God.

28:30.640 --> 28:35.000
Hugh, check it out - Malcolm
Tucker is leaving the building.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.240
Oh, right, yeah. Oh, I just wanted

28:35.000 --> 28:39.240
to say, well done, you slippery fuck.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.960
Should be able to weasel out of this
smelling like a perfumed trollop.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.480
Thank you. No problem.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.880
Hey, I'm going to have a swear box
installed on Monday, by the way.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.800
What? Fucking joking, you twat.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.160
Right. I'm in turbo.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.520
Laters.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.040
Oi, how you doing?

28:58.840 --> 29:00.480
Goodnight. Night.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.360
