WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.200
Fancy a yoghurt bar?
No, it makes my throat go claggy.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.120
I'm actually really nervous
about tonight.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.320
Why? Oh, you know, last time I was
on 5 Live, I thought Simon Mayo

00:09.320 --> 00:11.840
was going to be a walkover
and it was a bloody nightmare.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.720
You just got unlucky there. I mean,
I suppose there has to be one person
that Simon Mayo doesn't get on with.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.840
Well, at least I've met
Richard Bacon before, at that
Red Cross thing... That's right.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.000
He's nice, actually. Made me
think I must listen to his show.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.520
Did you? No. Have you heard it?

00:26.520 --> 00:30.800
Well, only since we knew you were...
Can't wait to go back to Radio 4.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.880
Although of course I'm much younger
than their core demographic.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.360
I've started listening to Jamie
Theakston in the mornings. Uh-huh?

00:36.360 --> 00:39.120
Very, very sweet, apart from the
prostitute thing. Where is Ollie?

00:39.120 --> 00:42.000
This programme contains
very strong language

00:42.000 --> 00:44.640
This programme contains adult humour

00:44.640 --> 00:46.880
Relationship crisis. He has
to go and cook Emma a meal.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.000
Ollie? Does he cook? I thought he
lived off sandwiches and Tic-Tacs.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.120
Oh, look, they're here already.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.240
Why does the useless one
keep staring at me?

00:55.240 --> 00:57.200
Because she's a mentalist
and she loves you. Yeah.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.360
If you ever crash your car
on a mountain, she'll be the
one waiting to drag you out.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.960
Have you seen Misery?

01:01.960 --> 01:03.720
I'm in the fucking BBC, aren't I?

01:03.720 --> 01:06.160
Hello, everyone.
I'm Richard, the presenter.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.680
Good to see you. This is Janice,
the producer. Nice to meet you.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.560
Hello, lovely to see you again.
Again? Yes, British Red Cross do.

01:12.560 --> 01:19.520
Right, yeah, I remember, yeah.
Peter, how are you? That was great
at the Oval, wasn't it?

01:19.520 --> 01:20.680
It was such a good day.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.280
Got a little bit pissed.
Let's have a drink some time.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.880
Yeah, sure. Thanks for coming in.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.640
You probably know this. We've got
a breaking story about fat-cat
City bonuses

01:28.640 --> 01:33.000
and then piercings is after you
but I might read out some texts
about it during the interview.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.039
And also, it all goes out live
so absolutely no swearing.

01:36.039 --> 01:39.920
No swearing? Oh, we can all
thank our fucky stars for that!

01:41.720 --> 01:44.560
We're going to start the show.
All right, great. OK.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.360
Yeah, you're all in there.
It's the Green Room.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.200
We're all in there?
Yeah, tea, coffee and stuff.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.759
Nicola. Thank you.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.560
Terri? Oh, thanks, yes.

01:57.560 --> 02:02.040
The stupid one keeps staring at me.
Could you block the view possibly?

02:02.040 --> 02:03.520
Yeah, fine.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.480
Why isn't Emma here to help?

02:07.480 --> 02:10.080
She's dumping Ollie tonight. Result.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.680
Probably crying his eyes out
right now like Kate Winslett
losing on a scratch card.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.440
I thought you said you were
cooking dinner. I'm starving.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.640
I didn't realise you had
to cook lamb shanks
for a fucking fortnight.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.440
You shouldn't be using Phil's
courgettes. He counts them.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.160
Phil counts his courgettes?
Every night.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.200
As long as he doesn't do
anything else with them every night.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.920
Right, let's make the mood a little
bit nicer, little bit sexier.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.880
Oh, sorry, Ollie, I need that light.

02:34.160 --> 02:41.240
Sorry. Sorry, I was only being
romantic as I was ordered to
by the Romance Nazi.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.680
I'm going to talk to him.
It's stupid.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.200
OK, I'll come with you.
He's only two feet away.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.640
No, let me, honestly.
I'll be right behind you.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.880
So, hello, then, Peter.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.920
Hello, Nicola. Can I help you?

02:56.920 --> 02:59.760
I don't know. Sit down, Phil.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.920
Well, that's a nice tan you haven't
quite managed to get there, Peter.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.480
Oh, yes, that's very funny.

03:05.480 --> 03:10.080
Because of the shit storm you
created about my second holiday,

03:05.480 --> 03:10.080
I had to cancel my second holiday.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.520
I see what you did there.
You should be in stand-up.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.600
Ben Elton.
Yes, indeed, ladies and gentlemen.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.640
Sorry about the puffin.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.120
No, I don't give a fuck
whose birthday it is.

03:19.120 --> 03:24.280
I'm going to enjoy myself here,

03:19.120 --> 03:24.280
listening to this Murray-Mannion

03:19.120 --> 03:24.280
ding-dong on the radio.

03:24.280 --> 03:32.480
The fat-cat story's breaking so the
Opposition are going to be sweating
like Vegas Elvis on a squash court.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.120
Happy birthday, Malcolm.
Stop saying that, right?

03:35.120 --> 03:38.120
Just you go home. What is this?
Is this my new anal beads?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.960
OK, this has been X-rayed, yeah?

03:39.960 --> 03:43.600
Not going to get fucking...
a present bomb in the face.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.000
This could be from anyone.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.200
Ah, it's from the Prime Minister.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.280
This is fucking
Tom's idea of a joke, eh?

03:54.280 --> 03:56.680
And he wonders why we don't let
him out in public.

03:56.680 --> 03:57.920
Excellent.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.200
Â£15 from the Golden Temple and
expertly home-chopped vegetables.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.680
That's a beautiful night in.
What are you...?

04:04.680 --> 04:07.760
Oh, Ollie, that's absolutely
disgusting. It's not disgusting.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.000
It's fresh vegetables. I'm not
putting a raw sausage in, am I?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.240
This is fun, isn't it?

04:14.240 --> 04:19.000
Eh? Might be the most enjoyable

04:14.240 --> 04:19.000
meal we've had since I told your
dad off for using the M-word.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.440
Well, it's not my fault that Stewart
asked me to rewrite the CBI speech.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.280
I've got to listen to
this Richard Bacon thing.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.800
Talk radio. Ssh!

04:30.800 --> 04:32.400
Sexy!

04:32.400 --> 04:36.000
Don't worry. I've done some of my
best shagging to Caesar the Geezer.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.320
Can you stop talking shit for
a second, so we can listen to

04:36.000 --> 04:40.320
your boss talking shit instead?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.760
'Here's Richard Bacon.'

04:42.760 --> 04:47.120
You know...when your mum
walked out,

04:47.120 --> 04:50.240
do you think maybe that
wasn't just about your dad?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.360
Fourth sector, people power,

04:52.360 --> 04:54.880
inspiring each other
out of disadvantage.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.120
You need to put in
the linking words as well,
not just the headlines.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.640
I am going to talk in complete
sentences. I think you
should rehearse with those.

05:01.640 --> 05:06.520
OK, how about, "I believe in
people power. Will you fuck off,
Terri?" Is that OK?

05:06.520 --> 05:09.520
We call it the common-sense
check-list, Richard.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.800
We need to cut red tape and we were
talking about that at the Oval
the other day, weren't we, Richard?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.920
That's just the sound of wickets
falling. Stewart. Stewart? Ooh!

05:16.920 --> 05:21.600
Oh, good. I wonder what Mr Political
Correctness Gone Boring wants.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.920
Hi, Stewart.
Look, a little note for Peter, yeah?

05:24.920 --> 05:28.200
Time to dump the common-sense
check-list, yeah? It's an ex-list.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.200
The new world order is this.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.760
Hit the City hard, yeah?
It's reverse gecko.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.120
Greed is bad, money is awful,
I heart Tracy Chapman, yeah?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.800
He wants you to scrap the
common-sense check-list and

05:40.800 --> 05:44.120
hit the City hard over the bonuses,
call them all money-grabbing wankers.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.000
Would you like to come through? Yes.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.520
Phil.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.320
Some of my best friends are
money-grabbing wankers and I've

05:51.320 --> 05:54.680
got to give a speech to a room-full
of them tomorrow at the CBI lunch.

05:54.680 --> 06:00.560
I'm not going to say, "Hello, chums,
I've just taken a slash in the
soup," so, no. The answer's no.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.600
Stewart, Peter's not going
to want to do that.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.120
I don't want him to WANT to do it,
Phil. I want him to DO it.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.680
Stewart says it's a JB diktat.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.440
You have to do it. Tell him
to stick a goose up his arse.

06:09.440 --> 06:13.560
..struck on the foot
after Brett Lee ripped
through their batting line at Lords.

06:13.560 --> 06:14.720
Dimitri Mascarenhas is the man.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.000
Rice is difficult to get right,
isn't it?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.840
Rice is difficult to get right.
Why is that?

06:23.720 --> 06:25.400
God, this is hard work.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.640
Coming up shortly, we've got what
could be a rather fiery showdown

06:25.400 --> 06:30.640
between two political heavyweights.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.320
After trading blows in the dailies,
it's now time for them
to meet face-to-face,

06:35.320 --> 06:38.440
so it gives me great pleasure
to introduce Nicola Murray...

06:38.440 --> 06:45.520
Hello. ..Secretary of State for
the Department of Social Affairs
and Citizenship. Hello again.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.800
I got it right that time. Managed to
come in at the right time! Hello.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.800
And from the Shadow Cabinet, the
Right Honourable Peter Mannion MP.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.080
Hi, Richard, good to see you again.
The Mannion-ator!

06:56.080 --> 06:57.920
Guys, first of all...

06:57.920 --> 07:02.680
How old are you? Have either of
you got any piercings, any tattoos?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.760
I've got an appendix scar.
Does that count?

07:05.760 --> 07:11.080
Classic! You know how it is. I was
with a bunch of pals, got a bit
tipsy, rolled into casualty, yeah.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.560
Hey, we all got it done!
Yeah, in your face, bitch!

07:13.560 --> 07:16.920
That's very funny.
Nicola Murray, any piercings?

07:16.920 --> 07:19.200
Um... Er, er...no. Yes, you do.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.320
No piercings at all.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.840
You have got some piercings.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.040
OK, all right. Er, sorry,
no, no piercings at all, no.

07:27.040 --> 07:32.000
Um, some people say that
my distinguishing feature would

07:32.000 --> 07:37.720
be probably my ears, which
I'm told are quite small.

07:37.720 --> 07:42.920
Right. But I do think we have to be

07:37.720 --> 07:42.920
a little bit careful about taking

07:42.920 --> 07:51.200
too light an approach to culturally
sensitive issues like body piercing
or female circumcision... Earrings!

07:51.200 --> 07:52.880
Earrings! I've got pierced ears.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.880
Let's leave that there.
Fuck me, this is like a clown
running across a minefield!

07:58.880 --> 08:03.520
I'm really worried about Nicola.
She's behaving like a squirrel
trapped in a pedal bin.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.280
All I'm asking you to do is have a
word with...Blondie, the producer,

08:06.280 --> 08:09.760
and cut Nicola some slack because she
needs all the sympathy she can get.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.920
The problem is,
if you say to a journalist,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.480
"Can you avoid that topic?"
that's when they really go for it.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.600
It's like saying
to the school bully,
"I'll wet myself if you tickle me."

08:17.600 --> 08:21.080
Dear Richard,
I don't see the point of piercings.

08:21.080 --> 08:26.920
If you were a robot, you wouldn't
stick bits of dangling flesh
all over yourself, would you?

08:26.920 --> 08:33.360
Now, more on the breaking news
that bank bonuses have tripled

08:26.920 --> 08:33.360
in the past year. Peter Mannion?

08:33.360 --> 08:37.320
Well, some people are paid a great
deal of money for doing things that

08:37.320 --> 08:43.440
are...that are very special, like
top footballers or top entertainers,

08:37.320 --> 08:43.440
and so will...top bankers.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.400
Let's find out what the callers
make of it. Jim in Taunton...

08:46.400 --> 08:49.440
And we'll never know what

08:46.400 --> 08:49.440
Jim from Taunton's thoughts are.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.880
What are your thoughts tonight,
Emma from this flat?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.880
Actually, Ollie, we do need to talk.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.200
That sounds ominous, like "Did you
until recently have a cat?"
kind of, er...

09:00.200 --> 09:02.320
PHONE RINGS

09:00.200 --> 09:02.320
Hang on, I've got to take this.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.040
Oh, fuck this!
Right, OK, you do that.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.760
I will go for a shit with the
lovely Polly Toynbee. Stewart, hi.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.440
Emma, poppet. Look, Peter is going
almost violently off-message

09:12.440 --> 09:15.240
over at 5 Live so I'm afraid I'm
going to have to scramble you.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.880
I've sent a cab round.
Just call me when you're en-route.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.520
And if you get any problems,
solve those problems.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.160
OK, Stewart, I'm on my way.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.600
What? I've got to go to the office.
I thought we had to talk.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.720
CBI speech. I'll talk to you later.
Oh, right, OK. I've got to go.

09:28.720 --> 09:35.440
What we would be looking for is
getting people to inspire each other
out of poverty, out of disadvantage.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.080
How can you be "inspired"

09:37.080 --> 09:39.320
out of poverty?

09:39.320 --> 09:41.800
Well, I'm choosing to ignore
your rather cynical tone...

09:41.800 --> 09:44.000
No, I'm not being cynical,
Nicky Murray.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.640
It's a perfectly legitimate question.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.200
How can you be inspired
out of poverty?

09:50.200 --> 09:55.360
OK. You are being cynical, but
anyway, we'll park that. One of

09:50.200 --> 09:55.360
our initiatives is to designate...

09:55.360 --> 09:59.160
Nicola, fourth. ..certain people
as fourth-sector pathfinders.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.680
Now, they would be, er,

09:59.160 --> 10:02.680
pillars of a normal community...

10:02.680 --> 10:04.320
Give a little review.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.400
Have-a-go heroes, for example. No,
we're talking about everyday heroes.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.320
I assume you'd want to avoid
Charles Bronson style vigilantes.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.000
Oh, yes!
Yes, we don't want Charles Bronson.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.360
More Charles, er...er...Dance.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.600
Or Chaplin.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.160
Peter Mannion, the animosity
between you...

10:25.160 --> 10:26.800
MOBILE RINGS

10:25.160 --> 10:26.800
Out!

10:26.800 --> 10:27.840
All right!

10:28.160 --> 10:31.920
Is that Nicola's doctor? Probably
trying to book a circumcision.

10:31.920 --> 10:36.440
Malcolm? Are producing porno now
for the visually impaired?

10:36.440 --> 10:41.960
What? Because what I'm hearing here
on the radio is Nicola Murray
being roundly fucked.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.000
What is this - Bukaki at Bedtime?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.040
Just...fuck, put Ollie on.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.440
Ollie? Um, well, he's not here.
He's at home.

10:48.440 --> 10:54.560
Tell that fucking stick of celery
to get his arse out of there
and get down to 5 Live right now.

10:54.560 --> 11:00.520
Tell him to inject some energy into
Nicola's performance. At the moment,

10:54.560 --> 11:00.520
she's coming across

11:00.520 --> 11:03.600
like a Nazi float at the fucking
Notting Hill carnival.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.600
It seems to me what I call
a political meringue -

11:07.600 --> 11:11.960
sweet but lightweight
and very little substance.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.360
He's like bloody Ustinov, isn't he?

11:15.360 --> 11:18.040
It's such an old joke.
Can you please just get out?

11:18.040 --> 11:20.200
Can you both fucking
get out the studio now?!

11:20.200 --> 11:23.600
You and fucking Rupert Brooke,
just out!

11:23.600 --> 11:28.600
I know exactly what you mean.
The other day, the BBC sent me

11:23.600 --> 11:28.600
on a health and safety away day

11:28.600 --> 11:32.560
where they taught me how to carry
a cup of coffee.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.960
This is exactly what I mean.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.280
That makes no sense. That's nonsense

11:39.280 --> 11:43.360
and we need to say no
to the nanny state, boo to nanny,

11:43.360 --> 11:49.040
and claw back some
personal responsibility
in the name of common sense.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.000
Hang on,
we need to say "boo to nanny"?

11:52.000 --> 11:56.360
Yeah, it's just a...a...play on...

11:56.360 --> 11:59.040
Jools Holland's Hootenanny.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.760
I...I...didn't write it.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.480
It's, er...but, er...

12:03.480 --> 12:05.720
Hey, nanny, no. Right.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.960
- Oh, hello, nice dinner?
- Fuck off, Bagpuss.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.120
God, your hands are massive!

12:13.120 --> 12:16.200
It's already won
a few major awards...

12:16.200 --> 12:18.960
Glenn? Sorry, mate.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.400
Calling you in from your love nest
by the orders of Pol Potty-mouth.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.040
No, no, fine, I'm coming,
I'm coming. I am coming.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.160
I was just on the verge

12:25.040 --> 12:29.160
of saying that to somebody else,
only in a slightly higher voice.

12:29.160 --> 12:33.000
Can I just pause there to read
out some texts on piercings?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.880
"Dear Richard, my friend's daughter
got piercings all round her mouth.

12:36.880 --> 12:41.120
"She looks like she worked
in a ball-bearings factory
and there was an explosion

12:41.120 --> 12:43.840
"and all the shrapnel
got embedded in her face.

12:43.840 --> 12:44.880
"I don't like it."

12:44.880 --> 12:49.800
- Hey, that was quick.
Did you tell him?
- Kind of. He's getting the message.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.680
I couldn't say while you were
together, but I really don't

12:49.800 --> 12:53.680
know what you saw in him.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.640
You told me all the time
how much you hated him.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.920
That was one of the main reasons
I went out with him so long.
Are you splitting up with Ollie?

12:59.920 --> 13:02.040
Sorry, can you hear
all right over there?

13:02.040 --> 13:04.520
I can pop into the studio and get
some microphones so you can
get all the details.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.360
I can hear fine, yes. No, I

13:04.520 --> 13:07.360
think that's a really good idea.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.760
I mean, for your sake.
I'd back you up on that.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.200
I'd have your backing?
Oh, fantastic. Thanks.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.720
Emma, you're over-emotional.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.760
Why don't you go home,
drink some mojitos with your
girlfriends and talk about shoes?

13:17.760 --> 13:20.960
I've got it covered here.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.960
Yeah, well, actually
Stewart called me IN

13:20.960 --> 13:25.080
because he wanted me to
sat-nav Peter out of the dead end
you've driven him into.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.080
Perhaps you should piss off and read
that Marie Claire you nicked off me.

13:28.080 --> 13:35.400
Hi, Stewart, he's great, isn't he?
Boo to nanny? Phil, no-one
watches Jools Holland, yeah?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.320
We need to be appealing to
One Show man and Holby City woman.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.600
What's he saying?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.320
Just shut up, Emma,
the men are talking. Is Emma there?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.000
Yes, she is here. Thank God.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.360
Put her on, Phil. Stewart, hi.
This is the brief. Got a pen?

13:46.360 --> 13:48.560
Have you got a pen?
Yeah. You're not having it.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.760
Do you need a pen?

13:48.560 --> 13:51.760
I do, thanks, Sorry, Stew, hang on.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.640
Why don't you have one
just Sellotaped to your chin, Emma?!

13:54.640 --> 13:59.120
Write this down. Write on his shirt,
just write it down!

13:59.120 --> 14:01.960
I'm serious.
Are you listening to Daddy? OK.

14:01.960 --> 14:07.120
I want you to pull some info on City
bonuses - tax evasion, non-doms.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.120
Let's name and shame some fat cats.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.600
I want to hear some
fact-enforced noise.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.680
Terri?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.600
Terri, a word.
Could I have my pen, please?

14:15.600 --> 14:18.560
Oh, sorry, yeah, I wasn't gonna
keep it. It's a Parker, so...

14:18.560 --> 14:20.840
Those two are absolutely awful.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.640
She is a complete bitch.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.520
I think he might be simple.
Well, thank your lucky stars

14:25.520 --> 14:28.680
this is your chance to get away
from Princess Anne and
Captain Mark Phillips.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.840
I've done a list of the fat
cats and bonuses. I wonder if you'd
like to run this in to Nicola.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, sure. Good.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.280
Thanks, Glenn, for getting me in
on my special night off.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.760
Emma was furious
when I said I was coming in here.

14:39.760 --> 14:44.800
She was moaning, she was screaming,
and then I said I was coming in
here. Do you see what I did?

14:44.800 --> 14:49.080
I see. It's a funny joke
about my sexual prowess...

14:44.800 --> 14:49.080
What the fuck are YOU doing here?

14:49.080 --> 14:52.040
Oh, I'm having an affair
with Richard Bacon.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.560
I'm incredibly aroused by men
with meat in their surname.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.640
You...YOU told ME...

14:57.640 --> 15:02.000
I cooked a lovely meal...
Ordered, and it wasn't lovely.
What the fuck's going on?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.480
Sorry, I've just got to take
this call. I'll talk to you later.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.160
So...she did come.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.120
She came into work.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.600
Do you see what I did there?
Fuck off, man!

15:11.600 --> 15:14.040
..when you yourself
were actually in Cabinet.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.560
We have tried repeatedly
to initiate legislation which
will outlaw these bonuses.

15:18.560 --> 15:23.760
Now, your party has persistently

15:18.560 --> 15:23.760
blocked those attempts.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.040
I think it's an interesting point.
What do you say, Peter Mannion,

15:27.040 --> 15:32.120
to the accusation that these huge
bonuses, and the offence that they

15:27.040 --> 15:32.120
cause, are the fault of your party?

15:32.120 --> 15:37.480
I think that's a completely
fatuous argument when Nicola's party
has been in Government for what

15:37.480 --> 15:43.960
seems like about a century, and
bonuses under their watch have

15:37.480 --> 15:43.960
increased...what, five-fold?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.440
Oh, dear. Come on,
Nicola, pull your finger out.

15:46.440 --> 15:50.520
OK, fine, so you personally would
like to see more done to hit
the fat cats?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.440
Is that what you're saying?

15:52.440 --> 15:54.680
Well, yeah...yes, yes.

15:54.680 --> 16:00.640
I...I...would,
if the person receiving the bonus
hasn't performed well. I mean...

16:00.640 --> 16:04.400
Can I simplify this?
Would you outlaw bonuses?

16:04.400 --> 16:09.320
In the case of them
being undeserved, yes.
Which the bulk of them are,

16:09.320 --> 16:13.600
so basically you're saying
the bulk of your friends
in the City are disgusting.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.920
No, no, no, yes. Yes, but only if
the bonuses they receive are unfair.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.720
It's all right,
I think we've got your point.

16:21.720 --> 16:26.040
Thank you. Let's move on. Let's go
to Derek who's been waiting...

16:26.040 --> 16:30.560
Right, if you speak to me, I will
pour hot coffee on your balls.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.840
Hey, I don't want a fight.
I want to clear the air, actually.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.440
We're like those two little
old people in the weathercock.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.640
You come out, I'm in there,
and we're swapping round.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.320
You're Mr Sunshine, are you?
I'm Mr Sunshine!

16:42.320 --> 16:44.240
You're a little wooden...

16:44.240 --> 16:46.920
twat in a little wooden house.
We could be friends.

16:46.920 --> 16:51.080
I'm thinking, you know, two enemies
and they come together
when they realise it is no more.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.280
Aragorn and Boromir.
Me, Aragorn, the true king.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.240
You, Boromir. Your horn is
broken and will be blown no more.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.360
This inability to talk without using
Lord of the Ring metaphors is one of

16:59.360 --> 17:02.520
the very many reasons that
we could never be friends. OK.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.599
By the way, you'll be getting a bill.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.720
That's OK.
I presume you're expecting that.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.000
OK, I'll bite.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.680
Why will I be getting a bill, Phil?

17:11.680 --> 17:17.359
Well, let me see -
partial rent, electricity,
gas, internet use, toilet paper.

17:17.359 --> 17:21.079
Kept a note every time you were
round at the flat. You're moving out?

17:21.079 --> 17:26.119
Oh, that's a shame. I'll miss
doing that secret and bad thing
I did with your roll-on deodorant.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.160
I'm not moving out.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.800
I'm just guessing that, seeing
as Emma's dumped you, you won't
be coming round much any more.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.000
What?
Oh, let me just savour this moment.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.680
Oh, thank you, God.
She hasn't told you, has she?

17:37.680 --> 17:39.720
What? She's dumped you.
She did it tonight.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.000
No, bullshit.
She didn't do it tonight.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.040
Let me get a little photo
of this moment. No, please...

17:45.040 --> 17:48.040
A new desktop picture here.
Put the fucking phone down.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.720
She told me! Why would she tell
you first, dickwad? I've no idea.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.200
She told me to get out the flat
tonight so she could dump you.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.840
In the words of Shakespears Sister,
you're history!

17:56.320 --> 17:57.360
Oh, fuck!

17:57.360 --> 18:01.520
It's a dark suit and it's
only lukewarm. I still win!

18:01.520 --> 18:05.560
Jim Henderson, what's your point?
Is that Jim Henderson from Clifton?

18:05.560 --> 18:09.440
You two know each other?
We've met, we know each other.
We've met. Yes, we have met.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.920
Surprised to hear you
turning on the City boys.

18:11.920 --> 18:16.960
You never found the JFU donating

18:11.920 --> 18:16.960
huge wodges of cash
to your party disgusting.

18:16.960 --> 18:22.000
Well...well...that's a separate...
Even though everyone knows they've

18:16.960 --> 18:22.000
got links with sweat shops.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Wow. What? Well, this is
quite an extraordinary allegation.
A very serious...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.240
Yes! Linked to sweat shops?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.440
That should be looked into...

18:30.440 --> 18:32.720
Oh, it's my birthday!

18:32.720 --> 18:35.360
..know the facts.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.160
I've just told you the facts.
Are you calling me a liar?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.360
I can't believe my ears.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.880
Did we just break a story that wasn't
"The Ipswich manager's got sacked"?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.640
It's my birthday!

18:44.640 --> 18:47.080
Cunt cake? Go ahead.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.920
Right, Emma, look, look, look,
I'm just coming in, OK?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.800
Yeah. I'll be 20 minutes, right?

18:51.800 --> 18:55.680
See if you can get Peter to do
something inoffensive
for 20 minutes.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.600
Hard-boil four eggs.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.080
You tell fucking Man at C&A that
I'm dumped before me, is that it?

19:02.080 --> 19:03.680
I thought he knew. Sorry.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.360
Fucking twit.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.360
Do you mind keeping it down?
Some of us are trying to listen.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.920
Peter's tearing through her
like a Viking at a nunnery.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.840
If he's a Viking, he's King Cnut.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.040
What? Yes, he's drowning
in the party donations.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.120
- You should listen.
- Bullshit.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.200
Emma, just... Emma! Ssh!

19:19.200 --> 19:21.680
You can't even fucking look at me.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.280
We're trying to listen here now.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.160
Fuck off, Phil!

19:23.280 --> 19:27.160
ALL TALK AT ONCE

19:27.160 --> 19:28.720
OK, do you want to shut up?!

19:28.720 --> 19:33.040
If you lot don't keep this down,
I'm going to have you all ejected

19:28.720 --> 19:33.040
from the building. You are the worst.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.800
My chair still smells of
your perfume! Excuse me!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.880
For the record, I have done nothing.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.480
Yes, that will be
your epitaph, Terri.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.600
We need to go to the news and sport
here. Just before that, a quick text.

19:43.600 --> 19:51.040
"Dear Richard, I love piercings.

19:43.600 --> 19:51.040
They are part of who I am, literally.
Tina in Weymouth."

19:51.040 --> 19:53.240
Where the fuck
are Terry and June going?!

19:53.240 --> 19:55.240
Good, yes! I'm cooking now!

19:55.240 --> 19:59.000
Cooking with gas.
I'm fucking DS Metcalfe!

19:59.000 --> 20:05.240
I'm cracking eggs, I'm pouring
in baking powder, I'm using
fucking vanilla extract!

20:05.240 --> 20:08.440
That was not good.
That was the opposite of good.

20:08.440 --> 20:12.240
Bad? How do I counter?
Have you heard of JFU?

20:12.240 --> 20:15.480
I didn't actually hear that bit,
so I don't know. You couldn't hear?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.480
Christ! You're... Sorry.

20:17.480 --> 20:21.680
You're here to hear, Phil.
Why do you think you're here?!
You're here to hear!

20:21.680 --> 20:25.880
You're not here for eye candy!
Look, it's not my fault.
It was very noisy in here.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.600
Ollie and Emma were splitting up
and I couldn't focus...

20:28.600 --> 20:30.680
Why's Emma here?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.680
Stewart sent her down here.

20:30.680 --> 20:34.080
Why have you got wet trousers?
Ollie threw coffee at me.

20:34.080 --> 20:37.960
I'm sorry, I seem to have wandered
into some 1970s' Ray Cooney farce.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.760
Is the vicar about to come
round with Robin Askwith?

20:40.760 --> 20:43.000
Headphones on ears, arses on chairs.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.760
Ollie, we don't make any time
for each other any more.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.840
We're busy people, we work
really hard. We work harder
than Fat Pat's arteries...

20:49.840 --> 20:51.960
Did you used to make
time for each other?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.680
I mean, I think that's the
crucial question. Sorry...

20:54.680 --> 20:58.360
OK, just for a second, Aunt Terri,
fuck off. Where am I meant to go?

20:58.360 --> 21:04.000
Pretend you've got to go and have
a shit. Or something. You're going
to be a lot better off without him.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.760
What do you mean, I'm going be...
Sorry, do you talk about me at work?

21:07.760 --> 21:12.520
Fuck this.
This is like that nightmare I had
about being on Loose Women.

21:12.520 --> 21:17.000
- Everyone knows that
Schumacher is the Stig.
- I think that was just publicity...

21:17.000 --> 21:18.520
Right, back to Loose Women.

21:18.520 --> 21:23.640
Friend of mine thinks it's actually
May, Hammond and Clarkson, purely
cos Stig is an anagram of gits.

21:23.640 --> 21:28.040
He should not be talking about me
at all, let alone about things
that are totally private.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.120
Then the bank bonuses
are very high, aren't they?

21:31.120 --> 21:35.440
I know you've been talking about me,
Terri, because I've got this weird

21:31.120 --> 21:35.440
Derren Brown thing going on

21:35.440 --> 21:36.840
where I can see and hear things.

21:36.840 --> 21:41.160
So, Ollie, what exactly have
you been saying to them
in the office about me?

21:41.160 --> 21:47.280
I've been saying you smell of
fennel, you're racist, you torture
horses and you're in the Bangles.

21:47.280 --> 21:51.360
That's what I've been saying about
you at work. I think you've
been sexually bragging.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.600
Don't flatter yourself.

21:52.600 --> 21:57.360
Emma, I didn't send you here to chat
about your sex life. You're here
to back-block Peter's narrative.

21:57.360 --> 22:01.840
And what's happened to Phil? Don't
get me wrong, I like it, but I'm
not seeing him in man-made fibres.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.680
He's just drying his...
He's drying his trousers.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.280
I don't want to know.

22:09.280 --> 22:12.560
Your party created spin and we
had to respond... No, no, no...

22:12.560 --> 22:14.480
How perfect. Who should walk in...?

22:14.480 --> 22:16.200
I'm Stewart Pearson.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.440
You see the fat man that you're
berating like a pinata?

22:19.440 --> 22:21.920
Well, I own him. Peter Mannion,
that's a fascinating...

22:21.920 --> 22:25.000
And, as we speak, who should come
rolling along the corridor

22:25.000 --> 22:30.560
but Malcolm Tucker,

22:25.000 --> 22:30.560
the man who was once referred to
as the Gorbals Gerbil...

22:30.560 --> 22:33.000
Don't do a joke.
Peter, don't do a joke.

22:33.000 --> 22:39.680
Peter Mannion, can you explain,
please, why your party spin doctor
has arrived entirely unannounced?

22:39.680 --> 22:44.320
I would say it was an indication
of how seriously our party is taking

22:44.320 --> 22:46.600
the allegations
that we were receiving...

22:46.600 --> 22:49.120
Don't say it again! ..donations...

22:49.120 --> 22:52.360
- From a sweat-shop labour company.
- Ooh!

22:52.360 --> 22:54.760
You prep him with this shit, yeah?

22:54.760 --> 22:58.480
Yeah, the last thing I said

22:54.760 --> 22:58.480
to him was go in there and bomb.
Well, it fucking worked!

22:58.480 --> 23:02.120
Usually he comes across like just
another third-rate Donald Sinden, but

23:02.120 --> 23:06.000
tonight he's like a ventriloquist's
dummy that's fucking falling to bits.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.240
It's nice to see you without those
veins in your temples throbbing.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.160
You've got your work
cut out with him!

23:10.160 --> 23:13.680
Look at the hair!
You've got to do something.
He's like fucking Swiss Toni.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.120
This is radio, but it's great to be
getting this straight from you,
thanks.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.320
Do you both have to
make so much noise?

23:19.320 --> 23:22.040
I don't know if they told you
this on your training day, love,
but this is fucking soundproof.

23:22.040 --> 23:26.440
- They can't hear you.
We're like Ted Moult to them.
- Look, can you please get out?

23:26.440 --> 23:30.680
No, actually we are entitled to be
in here. They should all be in here.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.800
All of their political advisors
should be in here.
I'm going to get them.

23:33.800 --> 23:38.560
Night in, night out,
it strikes me that one
or both of you are in trouble.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.400
Well, I can assure you it's not me.
Er...

23:41.400 --> 23:43.200
I just want to add
to the party atmosphere.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.600
We're perfectly entitled... There
is a text here from Tim in Ruislip.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.120
This is what Tim's text says.
Nicola is a hypocrite.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.560
JFU also donate to the Government.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.040
In fact, they donate twice as much
as they do to the Opposition.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.800
Can I just say to the listeners,
I have no idea what's going on now.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.960
We're in a studio,
there's another room...

24:01.960 --> 24:03.320
We have to get out, right?

24:03.320 --> 24:05.000
OK, let's get you all...

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
What do you reckon, Malcolm?
Seems like the big issue to me.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.680
We've got to move onto piercings.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.280
Janice, in the interest
of balance...

24:11.280 --> 24:13.520
Right, can you shut up, right?!
Malcolm's right.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.320
I decide what is news.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.320
Absolutely.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.240
And this is fucking news.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.240
Bullshit!

24:17.240 --> 24:21.400
Right, look, see this here? You do it
and I will press this fucking button.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.000
Don't fucking threaten me.
Richard, Tim in Ruislip.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.400
We've just received this text from
Tim... She's actually put it through.

24:27.400 --> 24:32.240
..and he says, "Nicola is
a hypocrite. JFU also donate
to the Government.

24:32.240 --> 24:37.360
"In fact, they donate twice as much
as they do to the Opposition."

24:37.360 --> 24:40.680
That's your fucking career over,
right, OK? You're fucking dead.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.840
And those three little words -
Tim in Ruislip -

24:42.840 --> 24:46.920
are the fucking nails in your coffin,
dear. Tim...in...Ruislip.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.600
Tim in fucking Ruislip!

24:49.600 --> 24:51.440
And as for Tim in fucking...

24:51.440 --> 24:54.440
Yeah, OK, can you stop
fucking saying that, please?!

24:54.440 --> 24:57.280
He's fucking dead as well,
that fucking texting coward.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.880
Give me his number.
What's his fucking number?

24:58.880 --> 25:01.240
- Give me the fucking number...
- Click off the screen now.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.440
If you don't give me his
fucking number, I'm going to
have to fucking go to fucking Ruislip

25:05.440 --> 25:11.360
and fucking snap the thumb and
forefinger off of every single

25:05.440 --> 25:11.360
person I see who I think resembles

25:11.360 --> 25:16.280
the kind of wanker that'd be walking
around in this day and fucking age

25:11.360 --> 25:16.280
with a name like fucking Tim!

25:16.280 --> 25:18.200
How do you think that sounds, huh?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.760
Quite, quite mad.

25:22.280 --> 25:26.720
You and I have to have a word.
He wants me to step outside.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.160
Right, you're on, mate.
I want you in there,

25:29.160 --> 25:32.880
rattling your fucking jewellery
and talking about your fucking

25:29.160 --> 25:32.880
Prince Albert. Come on.

25:32.880 --> 25:37.680
He doesn't actually work here.
Vamoose! You lot, fucking vamoose!
Johnny fucking Depp, get in here.

25:37.680 --> 25:42.440
I'll fucking shove a fucking magnet
down your throat and watch your
fucking face implode. Get in.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.400
Here he is. Piercings. Sit down here.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.520
I assume you're
for the piercings debate.

25:47.520 --> 25:53.360
Here's the fucking thing. Nobody

25:47.520 --> 25:53.360
talks about fucking dodgy donors, OK,
because it makes everybody look bad.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.440
OK, I'll go
the different angle, then.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.360
How do you think it would land
with your female voters
if they were to find out

25:59.360 --> 26:02.480
that Tom Rudd forced his secretary
into having an abortion?

26:02.480 --> 26:06.240
That was her own personal choice
and, by the way, it wasn't his.

26:07.280 --> 26:12.200
So him paying for a private clinic,
then, was just because he's such

26:07.280 --> 26:12.200
a nice man? He is a nice man.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.600
What about your nice man
at Central Planning, eh?

26:14.600 --> 26:19.400
The one who got a bit carried away
and fucking slapped his kids a little
bit too much. Fucking broke the skin!

26:19.400 --> 26:23.400
He wasn't such a nice man, was he?
But I suppose that's just part
of your common-sense check-list.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.200
All they need's a good slap
but do please remember to
leave your fucking rings on.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.800
You got your facts wrong, Malcolm.
That was a domestic accident.
Domestic accident?

26:29.800 --> 26:33.480
He's got fucking hands the size
of fucking doors! Oh, you want
to talk about hard men, Malcolm.

26:33.480 --> 26:38.000
Now, I know you've got to be hard
to be a chief whip, but really, coke
dealing at university? Oh, please!

26:38.000 --> 26:41.360
Am I right in thinking that he's now
godfather to one of the PM's kids?

26:41.360 --> 26:44.160
At the back of my fucking
filing cabinet, I've got
a fucking photograph that

26:44.160 --> 26:49.240
I've been waiting for a fucking
rainy day to show everyone, a photo
of your fucking Shadow Chancellor

26:49.240 --> 26:54.000
at one of his fucking parties,
dressed up in fucking bra,
suspenders and fucking black face!

26:54.000 --> 26:56.960
What's his defence going to be, eh,
when I email that to the fucking Sun?

26:56.960 --> 26:59.200
Oh, well, I am just
de Shadow Chancellor.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.200
He won't have a defence
because you haven't got that picture
because that didn't happen.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.200
However, I do have a statement
from a rent boy...

27:05.200 --> 27:09.200
Oh, you can claim that against
your expenses, can't you? Very

27:05.200 --> 27:09.200
funny. Or do you get that for free?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.880
This statement says he will swear

27:11.880 --> 27:16.040
that one of your prominent
back-bench MPs paid him
to sit on his chest.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.120
Don't...!

27:23.240 --> 27:25.280
Look, this is out of order, OK?

27:25.280 --> 27:31.280
Here's the deal.
We both make statements
saying that our guys in there were

27:31.280 --> 27:36.440
not in possession of all the facts,
hmm? But we're looking into it.
You'd do that?

27:36.440 --> 27:39.040
Hang your own guy out
to fucking dry?

27:39.040 --> 27:42.160
What, Peter Mannion MP,

27:42.160 --> 27:45.320
Old Guard? We're not sending
him to DoSAC to fatten him up.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.120
We're putting him out
to pasture, Malcolm.

27:48.120 --> 27:54.480
We should just go home. We can
do that. We can just seal this,

27:48.120 --> 27:54.480
contain the toxicity, Chernobyl FM.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.960
Carry on like this and I
might not find you utterly
fucking contemptible.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.040
That's an incentive.
I'll get my bag.

28:01.040 --> 28:06.160
Have a look at Ben there.
Do you think that's art?

28:07.680 --> 28:12.160
Well, it's...it's...not really
for me to say and, of course,

28:12.160 --> 28:13.200
there's quite a lot

28:13.200 --> 28:14.480
of tattoos there

28:14.480 --> 28:16.200
as well as piercings.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.280
And also if you can
take your Wii Fit.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.160
I bought you
the Wii Fit as a present.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.200
I don't want it.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.840
Well, you could fucking use it.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.200
What did you just say?

28:24.200 --> 28:25.360
They crucified him and it was

28:25.360 --> 28:26.520
because it was that programme,

28:26.520 --> 28:27.520
but it's good

28:27.520 --> 28:28.560
that he's found his way back.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.960
If it had been Magpie,
nobody would've cared.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.760
Well, no-one cared about Magpie.

28:31.760 --> 28:32.880
We didn't watch it in our house.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.360
Oh, happy birthday, Malcolm.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.160
Don't you fucking start.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.400
It's not a special one, is it?

28:37.400 --> 28:38.520
50th? Nah.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.840
Er, excuse me, is this
a car for Nicola Murray?

28:40.840 --> 28:42.600
Well, she said I could take it.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.880
Well, good night, Malcolm.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.760
See you on election night.
I'll pop round, pick up the keys.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.640
What is this? Are you working
the railways or something?

28:48.640 --> 28:51.840
Andrew in Suffolk writes,
"The body is a temple.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.600
"Temples aren't made of metal.
Case closed."

28:54.600 --> 28:57.280
You couldn't turn that
to Magic FM, could you, mate?

28:57.280 --> 28:58.640
Or I'm going to have to tear

28:58.640 --> 29:00.360
my eyelids off and scrunch them up

29:00.360 --> 29:01.480
into fucking ear plugs.
