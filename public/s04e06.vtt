1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.200
This programme contains some strong language.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.320
Tickel's dead!

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.040
I need to have the e-mail. I'll do it.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.480
Are you for the chop, Mrs Murray?

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.720
Ha-ha(!) Very funny!

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.520
Quiet Batpeople on every fucking paper!

7
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.520
What are you doing at my computer?!

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.920
I'm bringing down Mannion by leaking an e-mail.

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.080
Mr Tickel's medical records were illegally acquired.

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.240
I have decided to stand down as leader.

11
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.800
The Guardian have received an e-mail from Fergus

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040
with all of our comments about Mr Tickel underneath.

13
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.480
You were supposed to redact it, send the top e-mail,

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.120
not the whole fucking exchange!

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.840
If a government can't leak, do you know what happens?

16
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.560
Dark shit builds up.

17
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.480
What the fuck is going on? There's going to be an inquiry.

18
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680
And then it bursts!

19
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.720
This is an inquiry into the death of Mr Douglas Tickel,

20
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.880
and the practice and culture of the dissemination of confidential information

21
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.880
between political parties and the public media.

22
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.240
Mr Weir.

23
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.120
Thank you, Lord Goolding.

24
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.200
Our first witness today is, er, is Mr Stewart Pearson.

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.880
No, it's... It's fine.

26
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.040
Er, yeah, um, I, Stewart Pearson, do sincerely declare and affirm

27
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.960
that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth,

28
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.320
and, and nothing but, er, the truth.

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.240
On page 235 of your witness statement,

30
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.040
you describe yourself as the, the human router in government.

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.960
Can you, er, can you explain what you meant by that?

32
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.280
Um, I'm a-a router

33
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.120
in the sense that I control the governmental, informational

34
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.280
ingestion and egestion process.

35
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.760
Mr Pearson just to clarify -

36
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.160
your job is to make sure that the public perception

37
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.520
of your government's programme is a positive one. Is that fair?

38
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.400
It's not about perception. Yeah?

39
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.320
I believe in government as a transceiver, hm?

40
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.920
Transceiver.

41
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah, it's really important, sure, to give out a strong signal,

42
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.840
but to be effective, you've got to listen for an echo.

43
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.440
Could you possibly speak in plain English?

44
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.840
I'm sorry, I-I thought I was.

45
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.920
So what IS clear is that you are an important man, Mr Pearson.

46
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.800
I'm just a lad from Leeds with a lust for life, yeah?

47
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.760
There's an African proverb that's stuck with me, yeah?

48
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.200
"If you think you're too small to make a difference,

49
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.240
"you've never spent a night with a mosquito."

50
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.960
So...part of your job...

51
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.240
is to make sure that the government's message gets across clearly?

52
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.040
Is that right?

53
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.480
That's correct.

54
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.880
And despite the sarcasm marinating that question, I'm very successful in that endeavour.

55
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.720
No, there was no sarcasm intended at all, Mr Pearson.

56
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.400
Sorry, I must have misread your...face.

57
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.080
Does your job intrude on your home life?

58
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.480
No.

59
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.080
No, when I close the front door, I...

60
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.880
I'm no longer Stewart Pearson.

61
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.560
When you, when you...

62
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.600
I mean, when I...when I close it from the...from the inside.

63
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.520
You know, when I close it from the outside then I...

64
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.880
then I very much AM Stewart Pearson.

65
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.200
So who are you at home?

66
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.400
Er, I'm a husband,

67
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040
I'm a...pardon me, a lover,

68
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.400
I'm a carpenter, I'm a cook, I'm a flautist.

69
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.800
A-a..? A flautist.

70
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.080
Right. I play the flute.

71
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.480
And I dabble on the Irish bodhran.

72
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.440
Erm, and would you like to express any remorse for Mr Tickel's death?

73
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.760
What would you like to say to his family?

74
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.600
Er, I would like to offer them maximum respect, you know?

75
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.520
And maximum remorse.

76
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.120
And maximum assurance that Mr Tickel did not die in vain.

77
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.960
We're here. You know?

78
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.480
How can we make the government and the media inclusive without being intrusive? Yeah...

79
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.120
And if we can answer that,

80
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.760
at least we can make sure there are no more Mr Tickels.

81
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.840
I mean that...I mean that not in the sense of, you know,

82
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.800
wiping out the Tickel family name.

83
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.480
I mean it in the sense that nothing like this will ever happen again.

84
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.960
Hello, Mr Pearson. Hi.

85
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.440
Tab 28 in your bundle there, page 263...

86
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.880
..a paper that you presented in 2006, The Iconography of Consensus.

87
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.960
Would you care to summarise the argument you present there?

88
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.160
Sure, yeah, the main thrust... Bearing in mind Lord Goolding's desire for plainness and clarity.

89
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
Right. OK.

90
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.840
Er, I hypothesise that...

91
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.960
Sorry.

92
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.640
I say...

93
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.840
..that the design structure for a parliamentary democracy

94
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.880
should be that of the Pompidou Centre.

95
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.400
Morally and structurally explicit and open,

96
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.240
a porous membrane.

97
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240
Maybe just a little bit plainer, Mr Pearson.

98
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.840
People...

99
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.560
should know, er...

100
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.200
..what politicians are doing.

101
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.840
Brilliant.

102
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.640
Thanks.

103
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.040
Government should be porous?

104
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.960
Yes. But not leaking?

105
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.120
Come on. If someone is determined to leak information,

106
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.800
there's nothing that anyone can do about that.

107
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.640
So as Director of Communications,

108
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.160
you are unable to prevent sensitive material

109
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.240
being communicated to journalists?

110
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.280
If someone chokes on a packet of crisps, do you issue an arrest warrant for Gary Lineker?

111
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.880
Is it fair to say that you have in fact changed nothing,

112
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.600
and government communications carries on exactly as they did before, by leaks and whispers?

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.320
No, it is not fair to say that.

114
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.120
In fact, as you disapprove and condemn these practices,

115
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.920
are they not more covert and more hidden and more secret than ever before?

116
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.560
I think that is also an unreasonable assertion.

117
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.960
In spite of your desire to create a political Pompidou Centre,

118
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.640
haven't you created the opposite, Centrepoint?

119
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.960
Everybody sees it looming over them, but nobody has any idea what happens inside.

120
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.520
I think there's some kind of club on the top floor.

121
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.720
So, Mr Pearson, have you identified the source of the leak...

122
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.400
No. ..of Mr Tickel's records?

123
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.240
No. Have you ever leaked yourself?

124
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.160
No.

125
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.120
No, I was, I was over that pre-Britpop.

126
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.720
Do you have any idea where the leak might have come from?

127
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.200
Well, you know, if this was CSI Miami,

128
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.360
I guess we'd be looking for the person who had the most to gain from the leak being made public.

129
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.080
Well, er, despite your shirt, this ISN'T CSI Miami.

130
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.560
Who do you think would benefit most from the leak?

131
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.320
Well, I guess I'd be sending David Caruso knocking on the door of Mr Malcolm Tucker.

132
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.400
Can I ask you, how would you describe yourself?

133
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.160
Er, I'm a media strategist.

134
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.920
So you would be Stewart Pearson's opposite number?

135
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.800
Er, well, I'd be Stewart Pearson's opposite

136
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.560
in every possible way, I think.

137
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.600
TITTERING

138
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.600
You have a lot of control and power over your party, don't you?

139
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.680
Ah-ha!

140
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.200
I wish, yes! Um, no.

141
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.120
I think that that's been overstated.

142
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.640
So this reputation you have as an enforcer,

143
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.160
that's completely misrepresenting you, is it?

144
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.960
It's baloney. Politicians who have to do things that they don't want to do,

145
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.360
such as resign...

146
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.080
er, because they've been caught with their fingers in the till, or, you know,

147
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.800
with their knickers up a flagpole or whatever, they...

148
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.760
sometimes it's very convenient for them to have a bogeyman.

149
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.160
"Malcolm made me do it." Well, I didn't make them do it.

150
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.200
These are people who just find themselves stuck in a room with one exit,

151
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.760
and I simply show them the door.

152
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.520
I've highlighted some quotes.

153
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.480
The Guardian.

154
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.440
"Malcolm Tucker has the physical demeanour and the political instincts

155
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.960
"of a velociraptor."

156
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.440
Yes, The Guardian, the newspaper that hates newspapers.

157
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.400
Telegraph... The Telegr-arse.

158
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.960
"Tucker's writ runs through the lifeblood of Westminster

159
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.080
"like raw alcohol, at once cleansing and corroding."

160
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.280
The Times.

161
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.800
"If you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker,

162
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800
"you have spilled his pint."

163
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.240
The Spectator. "Iago with a BlackBerry."

164
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.080
I mean, you're saying these quotes are, what, misguided?

165
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.200
The Spectator...! Um...

166
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.200
No, I'm saying you're taking these out of context, you're not contextualising these.

167
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.440
If you were to put them into a perspective, if you were to place them into the landscape,

168
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.040
you would see that there might be a lot of axes being ground here.

169
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.120
I don't see the difference between what you have just done and a leak, by the way.

170
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.520
The difference is that what I've just read out was not obtained illegally.

171
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.800
How do you know that?

172
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.760
You don't know what confidences have been breached

173
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.640
in order to form these opinions, for that is what they are.

174
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.000
So, you accept leaking as part and parcel of the political media machinery?

175
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.360
Yes, I mean if you didn't have leaking,

176
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.120
the newspapers would just be full of long-lense bikini shots,

177
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.440
and adverts for sheds, and offers to buy three pairs of trousers for a tenner, etcetera.

178
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.360
It's just... It's the way it is. Big deal, no-one dies.

179
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.280
One person did die, Mr Tucker.

180
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.480
Would you tell us how it works? You know, you do me a favour, I do you a favour. Yeah?

181
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.320
And what might you expect in return?

182
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.680
Anything. What?

183
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.920
Well, a Kit-Kat, you might get.

184
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.960
I've had a Kit-Kat, I've had, er, a-a big meal.

185
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.680
Could you give us an example?

186
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.040
Um... Well, yes.

187
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.120
I...

188
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.400
This is The Daily Mirror,

189
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.640
and I could get drummed out of the Magic Circle for showing you this.

190
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.480
Anyway, this is The Daily Mirror...

191
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.800
about the Quiet Batpeople, er, policy of Mrs Nicola Murray.

192
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.280
I was there that day. You can't see me cos I've been cropped out here,

193
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.840
but this information here, I made sure that those notes were in that place,

194
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.800
that they were available, and that the picture editor knew where to find them.

195
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.320
Sorry, I'm just trying to... trying to get this clear.

196
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.760
Was Mrs Murray not the subject of huge derision as a result of this?

197
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.880
Er, no she was a subject of huge derision before this.

198
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.480
LAUGHTER

199
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.960
But it was...

200
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.280
You were, you were trying to undermine the leader of your party?

201
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.520
I was...

202
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.760
Would you say you were a loyal man, Mr Tucker?

203
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.720
I'm loyal, yes. I'm loyal to my party

204
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.840
and I feel that Mrs Murray's policies were turning the party into...

205
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.080
I don't know if you've seen those calendars with pictures of dogs that are dressed up in...

206
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.680
They've got little dresses and hats on?

207
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.240
She was turning my party into that, she was humiliating my party,

208
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.560
so I thought it was absolutely vital

209
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.240
to focus the public's attention onto that.

210
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.760
And yet you maintain that you had great, I don't know, what, respect for Mrs Murray as a person.

211
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.920
Yeah. Yes. She was a great laugh occasionally. Great dancer.

212
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.200
She's got terrific...hair.

213
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.200
LAUGHTER

214
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.160
She did a good job at DoSAC.

215
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.000
A much better job than her successor, who, let's not forget,

216
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
was playing on a slide when the news of Mr Tickel's death came out.

217
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.120
Thank you, Mr Tucker, we're well versed in the events surrounding the death of Mr Tickel.

218
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.360
So tell me,

219
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.480
the PFI e-mail that led to the...to the resignation of Nicola Murray.

220
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.400
Did you... Did you engineer that?

221
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.320
Mr Tucker? No. No.

222
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.800
No, I didn't.

223
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.080
And, er, the leaking of Mr Tickel's health records?

224
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.720
I mean, do I detect your hand in that, for instance?

225
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.040
No. No, no, no, no, no.

226
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.400
Look, politics is a war, and politicians,

227
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.840
sometimes they lose ideological limbs. Right?

228
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.920
They get media shrapnel right in the face.

229
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.360
Sometimes they get a bullet right in the brain.

230
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.160
Civilians know there is no way that I would ever attack a civilian,

231
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.880
a real person, and especially not somebody

232
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.680
with a history of mental illness.

233
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.800
Because that sort of thing...

234
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.240
makes me queasy.

235
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.160
So you're an ethical...leaker?

236
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.360
I use leaking to show up corruption, to show up hypocrisy,

237
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.160
to show up idiocy.

238
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
And also the fourth horseman of the political apocalypse, duplicity.

239
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.920
For instance, Fergus Williams...

240
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.520
He's coming up next, right? Mm-hmm.

241
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.360
This is a guy, he's a member of the junior party in this coalition, right?

242
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.720
This guy has already opened a private channel to Dan Miller,

243
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.560
the Leader of the Opposition,

244
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.160
in order to talk about possibly setting up a coalition with him,

245
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.200
because he knows very well that this coalition government that he is lumbered with

246
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.720
is being torn to pieces, like a bread stick at a picnic.

247
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.880
Mr Tucker, you have just used this inquiry

248
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.960
to commit a leak in front of us!

249
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.480
I've not committed a leak! Everybody in Westminster knows these talks have taken place. Everyone.

250
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.920
You're supposed to be investigating this, discovering this stuff.

251
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.200
Now, you cannot not know what I or anyone else tell you. Right?

252
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.200
You can't not know that. You cannot not know what you now know.

253
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.800
Mr Tucker, are you familiar with the rules of association football?

254
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.400
I understand if you're going to have an affair you'd better take precautions,

255
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.720
like getting a superinjunction. I ask you because this is me giving you a yellow card.

256
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.720
You're not to use this inquiry to score political points.

257
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.760
Sorry, I'm...I apologise.

258
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.480
Did you see Mr Malcolm Tucker's evidence earlier?

259
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.000
Er, yeah, I, er, saw it out of the corner of my eye.

260
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.640
Do you want me to read what he said about you? No, that's fine. That was the bit that I saw.

261
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.080
Embarrassing, I imagine. Er, no, not at all.

262
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.000
Er, it was, er...almost flattering, yeah,

263
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.080
to get, er, to get Tuckered.

264
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.680
It's a right of passage in...in...in politics.

265
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.200
It happens to all of us, it's...

266
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.840
You know, it's like when you're in a Russian jail, you get your face tattooed.

267
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.160
Mr Tucker mentioned meetings between you and the Leader of the Opposition.

268
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.880
Did these take place?

269
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.160
They did, yes. Er, myself and Adam

270
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.760
were part of a team who had very general, non-committal discussions

271
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.680
with, amongst others... Mr Miller.

272
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.080
And you discussed a potential future coalition with his party

273
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.440
and the removal of your own party leader, is that correct?

274
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.640
Sorry, could I... possibly answer that question with another question?

275
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.600
I mean, not THAT question I'm just asking but a further question.

276
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.600
Go on.

277
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.280
You do realise that YOU'RE being spun here? You do see that?

278
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.240
Spun? Cos, you know...

279
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.240
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

280
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.960
Malcolm Tucker's not your common or garden spin...doctor, right?

281
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.920
No, he's the, he's the chief medical officer of spin.

282
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.680
He is Spinoza, you see, so he'd... He had...

283
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.400
He didn't come here in order to answer your questions,

284
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.600
he came here in order to get you to then ask HIS questions...

285
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.080
Mr Williams, I don't want you to answer with another question, I want you to answer it with an answer.

286
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.600
He's conducting you like, um...

287
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.760
..Goldie.

288
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.680
Did you talk to Mr Miller about removing your party leader?

289
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.800
Sorry, are you getting Tucker's questions sort of beamed straight into your brain?

290
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.880
Mr Williams.

291
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.040
Finally, on the subject of frustration,

292
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.360
would you say it's difficult to steer policy ideas through your department?

293
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.440
Huh...

294
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.400
Er, yes, there are...

295
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.040
..blockages. There is one person in particular,

296
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.160
and, well, you know, I don't want to identify her...or him,

297
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.760
if she was a man, but this particular person, er...

298
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.200
is...er, rather inept,

299
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.880
and has hampered a lot of our initiatives,

300
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.080
and she, or her-him, is, um...

301
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.400
..very difficult to remove.

302
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.760
And so she's a... He is a...

303
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.480
They are a stubborn blockage, shall we say,

304
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.960
like, you know, when you get hair and, um, soap in a plughole,

305
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.800
with...skin flakes.

306
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.840
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Williams. That's, that's fine.

307
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.480
Sorry, can I just say... We are very pressed for time.

308
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.720
Yeah, but I really didn't want the last thing that I said, erm...

309
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.200
I'm sorry. ..to be skin flakes. Thank you.

310
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.440
When did you first become aware of Mr Tickel?

311
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.800
When he became the only, erm, key worker

312
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.200
to refuse our offer of alternative accommodation.

313
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.160
Then he sort of dropped off my radar.

314
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.480
The next thing I knew, he was sewing badges on his tent

315
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.760
and shouting abuse through a loudhailer.

316
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.880
Did you ever feel yourself to be culpable in any way for his...

317
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.880
for his homelessness?

318
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.760
Look, he was homeless only in the sense that he had no home. Er...

319
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.600
LAUGHTER

320
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.640
No, no, a housing association flat was found, which he declined.

321
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.760
The POLICY didn't make him homeless.

322
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.720
The policy of selling off the block of flats where he lived.

323
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.120
He made a positive decision to be homeless.

324
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.560
It's the difference between being punched in the face and punching yourself in the face.

325
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.360
SNIGGERING

326
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.440
Um...

327
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.960
Well, and why do you think, to use your phrase,

328
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.040
he punched himself in the face?

329
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.520
Why? Well, because he was mentally, er, er...

330
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.080
Because he...he had, er...

331
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.760
mental issues.

332
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.240
The e-mail leaked to The Guardian,

333
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.680
which you'll find on pages 276 to 277 in the evidence,

334
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.320
one of your advisers describes Mr Tickel as...

335
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.800
erm, "fucking Florence Shiteingale".

336
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.520
Do you not feel that's, er, a little callous?

337
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.360
This is, this is rough and tumble office banter,

338
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.440
schoolboy showers stuff, and schoolgirls' showers, er...

339
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.720
Not that... I mean, not, not literally, but, er...

340
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.240
Are you familiar with the phrase "data smuggling"?

341
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.600
Data...what?

342
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.240
Passing on data from a closed system to an unauthorised source in exchange for money.

343
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.240
Oh, yes, I...I... Well, seems everyone's at it.

344
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.120
A...are you at it, Mr Mannion?

345
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.640
No, I'm...I'm...I'm not very good with technology.

346
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.720
The Papermate pen is still cutting-edge technology as far as I'm concerned.

347
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.480
Writes upside-down, you know!

348
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.560
You've told the enquiry that you didn't feel at all guilty

349
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.800
over Mr Tickel's death.

350
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.000
Well, I...I felt bad. B...but not guilty.

351
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.840
I didn't kill him, I've never killed anyone.

352
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.920
Noted, but I mean, do you think you could've made a difference

353
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.640
if you had been contactable that day? Why?

354
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.160
He wasn't trying to call me. I...I'm not The Samaritans.

355
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.520
In fact,

356
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.080
apparently, tonally, I have a very depressing voice.

357
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.200
Mr Mannion, do you know Mr Alastair Leyton,

358
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.760
a senior executive at The Times?

359
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.440
Yes.

360
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.800
Did you ring Mr Leyton on 25th April

361
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.000
to tell him that Mr Tickel's medical records had been unlawfully obtained

362
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.400
and that this might form the basis of an explosive news story?

363
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.320
Did I, er, ring him on that day, do you mean?

364
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.120
I, well, I can't remember.

365
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.040
Well, did you ring him on any day telling him?

366
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.000
Look, I came into politics to make a difference,

367
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.880
t...to dare, to get things done,

368
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.040
n...not to leak things,

369
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.040
or...or spin, or...or blag,

370
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.200
or...smuggle,

371
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.280
but to serve, with honest, hard work.

372
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.600
To do.

373
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.560
And did you DO something? Did you contact your friend at The Times?

374
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.480
No, I...I didn't do that.

375
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.800
Perhaps we could start by just giving us an idea

376
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.840
of what a... You know, what a special adviser does?

377
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.480
Um, er...

378
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.360
Well, technically, essentially, we just advise a minister.

379
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.280
Erm, sort of, media strategies, political strategies...

380
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.520
that sort of thing.

381
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.240
But you're not permanent members of the Civil Service?

382
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.160
Er, no, they're like the... the worker ants.

383
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.840
We're more like... Er, well, not the queens.

384
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.960
That would be, er, Peter Mannion and to a lesser extent Fergus Williams.

385
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.720
We're more like the solider ants that defend the queens.

386
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.720
Would you like to add anything, Mr Kenyon?

387
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.080
Yes, I'm not sure that the ant analogy helps...

388
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.560
at all.

389
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.200
Mr Smith, how would you characterise your relationship with Mr Kenyon?

390
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.400
Er, well, I... I...I think when you get two silverbacks like Adam and I in a room,

391
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.240
there's always going to be a certain amount of chest-beating, but, erm...

392
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.760
there's a mutual respect.

393
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.840
Would you agree, Mr Kenyon?

394
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.720
Yes.

395
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.960
What about data smuggling?

396
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.920
I...is that something that you were aware of?

397
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.960
Yeah, I mean of...of course I was aware of it. I think we all were...

398
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.240
Absolutely. Yeah.

399
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.920
..but I would say, I would say it was, er, it was endemic, it happens every time.

400
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.880
Endemic? It's commonplace.

401
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.520
Hospitals, er, anywhere with public information.

402
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.920
GPs, passport offices, you know, you name it,

403
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.680
they've all been known to slip information for money.

404
00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.960
Do any of you know of specific individuals

405
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.480
who will offer this... this information trade?

406
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.920
No. I don't, no. No.

407
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.640
Right, so just to clarify, you say that it's endemic...

408
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.160
Rife, absolutely.

409
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.040
..but you don't know anyone who actually does it?

410
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.080
No. No.

411
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.480
No, I mean, I could if I needed to. I...

412
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.560
have a very wide web of contacts.

413
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.800
Right, but it's not contacts...

414
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.160
not contacts that you use? Er, no.

415
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.120
My position is, if you leak, you're weak.

416
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.000
If I'm going to come at you, I'm going to come at you head on...

417
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.280
man-on-man.

418
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.040
That's how I like it... Er, politically speaking.

419
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.440
You yourselves were subject to a leak, weren't you, in The Guardian?

420
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.920
How did you feel about the e-mail containing your thoughts

421
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.120
about Mr Tickel's death?

422
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.120
Um, it was, it was shameful and it was insensitive...

423
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.440
Absolutely. ..and we would like to apologise for that.

424
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.640
It's, it's dreadful. I agree.

425
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.360
I mean, their comments were absolutely unforgivable, mortifying.

426
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.560
"How many Mr Tickels does it take to change a lightbulb?"

427
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.600
"He doesn't have a lightbulb, he's in a tent."

428
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.920
Mmm...

429
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.720
"How do you turn Mr Tickel into Mr Happy?"

430
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.600
"Lithium."

431
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.880
"What's the difference between Mr Tickel and Captain Oates?"

432
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.200
"Captain Oates has a less stupid name."

433
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.280
And one feel that is particularly cruel, Ms Messinger,

434
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.080
given... Mmm.

435
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.680
..Mr Tickel's mental health, erm, issues.

436
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.160
"The fucker's a nutbag."

437
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.280
I'm s...sor... I...I...I...

438
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.720
It... That is not OK.

439
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.280
Sorry.

440
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.840
If I could add a...a...a... a mea culpa here,

441
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.880
rather than-than dancing around it.

442
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.360
Others may choose to attempt to wriggle off the hook of, er, shame,

443
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.760
but, um, I cannot.

444
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.120
I cannot deny that my name is on those e-mails,

445
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.640
and yet I do not recognise that man.

446
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.600
It is me and yet it is another, and for that I am, um, truly sorry.

447
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.960
This has been a humbling moment in my quest

448
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.800
to become the man I know I can be.

449
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.120
How did you react to the news of Mr Tickel's death?

450
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.280
Shock. Absolute shock. Fell to pieces. Devastation.

451
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.000
Awful, I mean we couldn't believe it, it was...tragic...

452
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Can I just refer you to Dr Tara Strachan,

453
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.520
who I believe was in your department for a meeting at that time,

454
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.120
and she described the atmosphere in the office

455
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.480
as an atmosphere of elation,

456
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.720
and you, Mr Smith, were seen to be punching the air.

457
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.520
Do you remember doing that?

458
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.560
I, er... I do not remember to that.

459
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.920
S... Well, if you weren't punching the air, do you remember what you were doing?

460
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.240
I...I cannot say to that.

461
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.720
Is it fair to say that information coming in and out of DoSAC is...

462
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.320
sticky, for want of a better word?

463
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.360
Yes. I would certainly agree with that...to that.

464
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.560
If I...if I may speak freely at this point,

465
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.360
I...I think the reason for a lot of leaks coming out of DoSAC is that

466
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.840
it's very hard to get information out of the official channels.

467
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.120
There's a kind of blockage, is there? Exactly that.

468
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.000
Um, and an information blockage. Er, and it...and it...

469
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.520
and it has to find its way out through other...routes.

470
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.640
No, it is actually Terri Coverley, um...

471
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.240
who is Head of Press, in name only.

472
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.400
Good, yes. It's Terri, definitely. Yep.

473
00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.120
I, Teresa Jessica Coverley, do sincerely declare and affirm

474
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.240
that the evidence I shall give will be the truth,

475
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.320
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

476
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.040
Please be seated, Mrs Coverley. Thank you very much.

477
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.560
Mr Hodge has some questions.

478
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.720
Very good to see you this morning, infamous Terri Coverley.

479
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.040
SHE LAUGHS DARKLY

480
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.320
Why are you smiling? I'm not smiling.

481
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.760
Yeah, or rather I'm smiling, but it's something I do when I'm nervous, erm...

482
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.640
And you have a guilty conscience? No, no. No, no.

483
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.600
No, I don't have a guilty conscience but I do have a guilty face.

484
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.720
Um, I...I...

485
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.760
I do blush a lot and that's a circulation thing, not a moral thing,

486
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.800
though I do ACT guilty, um...

487
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.120
When I was a child, um...

488
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.080
my brother's hamster was put into a remote control...aeroplane.

489
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.920
Tragic consequences, and, um... unfortunately I was blamed for that,

490
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.600
though I had nothing to do with it. It was...it was that I just looked guilty,

491
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.640
so I would ask you... to bear that in mind.

492
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.200
Can you explain to us how communications works in government?

493
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.160
Well, um, I use an analogy.

494
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.080
Erm...

495
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.680
I like to think that dealing with the press

496
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.520
is not so much herding cats, it's more herding sheep,

497
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.280
and I am the shepherdess, um...if you like.

498
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.920
It's, it's... In order to be an efficient shepherdess,

499
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.160
one needs a number of things, I mean...

500
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.080
Firstly, one needs a whistle, that's my voice.

501
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.280
Secondly, one needs a coat, and that's my coat.

502
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.520
And thirdly, one needs a dog,

503
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.840
and that, in my case, is a lady called Robyn.

504
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.640
How was your relationship with Nicola Murray?

505
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.560
Professionally or personally?

506
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.360
Professionally. Not good.

507
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.960
And personally?

508
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.440
Not good. No, I mean she resented me, she was jealous of me, I think.

509
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.920
I mean, a lot of women are.

510
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.200
It's no secret that... Well, she's a woman who has issues, er...

511
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.120
Major issues.

512
00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.120
I felt... If you want me to be truthful, I felt very sorry for her.

513
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.320
And your relationship with Peter Mannion?

514
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.400
Oh...

515
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.800
Yeah, very, very, very good.

516
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.440
Um, yes. Both professionally and personally.

517
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.800
Although of course, I... I draw a...you know, between the two.

518
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.040
But he's a lovely man to...work with, to be...to be with,

519
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.480
to be close to, and...

520
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.160
Several others have referred to you as a blockage.

521
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.640
Perhaps they meant...

522
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.320
"buffer".

523
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.800
Because I am a buffer between their heads...

524
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.080
and things that want to hurt their heads.

525
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.760
Who, in your opinion,

526
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.480
was responsible for the PFI e-mail being leaked?

527
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.400
Well, it's not for me to say,

528
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.520
and I don't want to be accused of telling tales before school...

529
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.520
But I think it was Malcolm Tucker.

530
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.240
Why do you think that? Erm...

531
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.840
Feminine intuition.

532
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.400
Feel it in my water.

533
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.440
Any reasons beyond your bladder?

534
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.160
Well, Malcolm can be very, very tough. I mean, that's no secret.

535
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.840
Can you give me an example?

536
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.120
Well, he can send very forthright texts.

537
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.360
Would you say he was bullying?

538
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.480
Well, I can look after myself.

539
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.280
I mean, I wasn't bullied at school. I was very popular.

540
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.800
But if you were somebody w...who... who had been bullied at school,

541
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.680
somebody who was weak or not popular,

542
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.320
someone like Robyn, for example, yes, I think Malcolm Tucker

543
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.080
would be very, very intimidating indeed, yes...

544
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.800
You're happy to go on record saying Malcolm was a bully?

545
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.040
Um... Malcolm is a bully?

546
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.640
Mmm...

547
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.960
We'll need a yes or a no.

548
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.640
Well, yes, then. Yes.

549
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.440
Mr Tucker is in next. I can't imagine he'll be very happy about that.

550
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.480
No, he won't. No, he won't.

551
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.000
(Right...) Well, I think we can leave it there, Mrs Coverley.

552
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.400
Oh, good. Sorry, I mean, thank you.

553
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.160
Thank you, thank you very much...

554
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.560
..Your Lordship.

555
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.360
We may need to call you back,

556
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.600
as I feel there are some issues that still need clarification.

557
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.440
Very good, yes, of course.

558
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.920
Thank you for agreeing to return to us at such short notice, Mr Tucker.

559
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.360
It's no problem. You only appear in front of the Goolding Inquiry twice,

560
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.920
once on the way up and once on the way down. Let's hope not.

561
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.440
Glad to see you again, Mr Tucker.

562
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.240
Nice to be here.

563
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.240
Did you watch the evidence given by Terri Coverley?

564
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.800
Yes. And I found her quite funny, without resulting to vulgarity.

565
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.080
She was very clear that she regarded you as a bully,

566
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.560
something you denied in your first testimony.

567
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.960
How do you respond to that?

568
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.760
Um, well, I respond thusly. That's slander.

569
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.200
We're trying to clarify the culture of communications

570
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.680
over which you presided.

571
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.880
And we have a contradiction between participants.

572
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.640
Well, I would say that I'm someone who lives and breathes communication,

573
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.360
so I would lend more weight to my words,

574
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.560
rather than to someone who is just in it for the pension.

575
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.280
And how is that not slander?

576
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.280
Well, because that's true.

577
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.520
She wants a pension more than Richard Hammond wants a punch in the face.

578
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.840
You know, she sat here for an hour.

579
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.320
You can't have looked at her and thought this was not a person who isn't mentally unrobust?

580
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.120
I'd like to return to the Batpeople photograph, if I may.

581
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.680
Why not? Yes, one of my triumphs.

582
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.160
You said you were cropped out of the original photo.

583
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.400
Sadly, yes.

584
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.960
But they have enlarged. Can we show the enlargement?

585
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.040
They've enlarged that photograph for us.

586
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.360
Now, could we go to the close-up of the folders

587
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.200
that you're carrying...

588
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.320
..in that photograph, there we are.

589
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.040
Who enlarged this? Er...

590
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.600
Was it The Guardian that did this for you? I believe so...

591
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.120
I didn't know they were offering that service. They should do passport photos.

592
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.960
Thank you. They'd double their revenue if they did passport photos a couple of times.

593
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.640
This is the folder that you are carrying in your hand,

594
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.880
and you see there there's a document poking up out of the top,

595
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.160
on the notepad.

596
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.240
Um, there's a series of numbers written across the top there.

597
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.160
Would you be able to tell us what the first two numbers are?

598
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.960
I don't... Well, they look like telephone numbers, I don't know.

599
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.360
Yes, they are Mr Tickel's mobile phone number

600
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.480
and his ex-wife's landline number.

601
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.880
Yeah.

602
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.480
Well, there's nothing untoward about me having those.

603
00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.040
Well, actually Mrs Tickel's phone number was ex-directory.

604
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.640
But let's just leave that to one side for a moment.

605
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.680
Very wise.

606
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.040
The bottom set of numbers.

607
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.640
Do you have any recollection as to what they might be?

608
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.760
No.

609
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.920
Really? You didn't even look.

610
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.880
Where are we going with this?

611
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.080
They are Mr Tickel's NHS number

612
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.520
and his National Insurance number.

613
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.440
Mr Tucker.

614
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.560
Ffff...

615
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.640
So why would you have that?

616
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.280
I don't, I don't recall...

617
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.720
Sorry, can I just clarify that?

618
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.480
Are you saying you don't recall having them,

619
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.440
or you don't recall how you obtained them?

620
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.800
Um...

621
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.320
I don't... recall having them!

622
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.000
But it... It appears to me that you have been rather careless

623
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.760
in this instance, Mr Tucker.

624
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.200
Not at all.

625
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.640
No? You were photographed with these papers,

626
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.520
you flaunted your ruse to puff yourself up,

627
00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.160
thereby drawing attention to this photograph,

628
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.840
this photograph which is now implicating you

629
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.360
in a rather troubling way.

630
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.160
Sorry, I didn't hear a question there.

631
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.360
Is there a question here?

632
00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.920
It was an observation, Mr Tucker.

633
00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.000
It's an observation,

634
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.040
so what are we, is this an inquiry or an observatory?

635
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.680
It's an opticians.

636
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.800
You'd like a question. Here is a question for you.

637
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.520
Do you have an explanation for having these numbers?

638
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.520
Those numbers are not necessarily what you say they are.

639
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.560
Did you request this information?

640
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.280
Um...

641
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.960
Because, Mr Tucker, if you didn't request the information, the only

642
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.640
other way that it could have come to you would have been if somebody had

643
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.840
supplied you with his NHS number, which would, of course, be illegal.

644
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.920
Yes.

645
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.800
Yes. As would obtaining his health records

646
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.600
and releasing them to the press.

647
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.160
Which you denied all knowledge of earlier,

648
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.040
and you would have committed a crime.

649
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.120
Well, I...

650
00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.800
Mr Tucker, a very serious crime.

651
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.280
Well, as you say, I denied it.

652
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.040
Yes. And, um...

653
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.080
Do you repeat that denial here?

654
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.360
I'm not sure that you know exactly how this all works.

655
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.560
Mr Tucker, are you repeating that denial?

656
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.640
Yes, I'm...

657
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.760
I... I am.

658
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.080
I deny it. I do deny it.

659
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.320
Thank you.

660
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.360
Of course you were, until quite recently, Leader of the Opposition.

661
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.800
You led your party for...

662
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.120
For two years, yes.

663
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.840
For 22 months and nine days.

664
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.840
Yes, I was rounding up.

665
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.000
How does it feel to lose that position so abruptly,

666
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.520
and so publicly?

667
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.240
Um, horrible. It feels horrible.

668
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.960
I think I felt as I would feel

669
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.840
if I were being strangled to death by somebody I trusted.

670
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.080
Yes, er, the press have been unkind to you over

671
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.120
much of your recent career, haven't they?

672
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.360
Well, when you're a high-profile politician,

673
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.920
you expect to be in the public gaze. Um, I would say that there's a...

674
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.200
there's a certain level of extra scrutiny that is afforded

675
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.720
to women in the public gaze, I'm sure you would agree.

676
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.680
Well, you were, um, followed around for six months

677
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.920
by a man dressed as a pork chop.

678
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.720
Is that the particular kind of scrutiny that,

679
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.880
that you're saying is reserved for women?

680
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.600
No, that was just reserved for me.

681
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.360
If we, um, just could turn to tab 16.

682
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.280
We have some articles, there's quite a few, actually.

683
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.760
On top of the second page here there is an exploded view of your face.

684
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.960
Yes, well they have, um...

685
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.000
They have magnified a picture of my top lip,

686
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.200
er, in the hope of finding a moustache, which I do not have,

687
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.360
I never have had a moustache, so...

688
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.920
If we, er, yes, again, if we turn to the fourth page of this tab.

689
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.040
"Frumpy, grumpy and dangerous to know."

690
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.960
"How Nicola Murray went from gold to lead in six months."

691
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.520
I mean, this is typical of, er, of many of the pieces

692
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.960
printed about you at the time, about a year ago, wasn't it?

693
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.000
Yes, it was.

694
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.640
Over 35 major articles.

695
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.200
Yes. Yeah.

696
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.600
I mean, I suppose the point I'd make is that we're sitting here

697
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.880
in our ivory, um, inquiry.

698
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.800
and out there, in the real world, there is actual news happening.

699
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.280
You know, we've got the chief whip's office, you know,

700
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.960
during the course of this morning has come under very particular scrutiny,

701
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.520
there are funding issues, there's the justice minister crisis

702
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.920
that's suddenly sort of spiralling out of control.

703
00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.400
I just, I don't quite know why we're, we're focussing on my moustache.

704
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.960
Which I don't have.

705
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.120
I'm afraid both of those very recent developments

706
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.760
may well be the subject of police investigations,

707
00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.840
so cannot be discussed in this room.

708
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.280
Which shows they've done the job.

709
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.320
Done the job?

710
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.360
Well, it just seems to me that somebody is engineering

711
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.920
this flurry of press reports in order to divert attention from the, er,

712
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.960
shall we say dramatic revelations of this inquiry. I mean, it just,

713
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.000
it just seems like there's another story every five minutes.

714
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.840
And who would that somebody be?

715
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.920
Well, um. I... Maybe we should ask Taggart!

716
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.880
Would you care to make a specific allegation against someone?

717
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.600
Er, no I wouldn't care to, no.

718
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.680
On a completely unrelated matter,

719
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.520
Malcolm Tucker was pleased to see you go, is that a fair statement?

720
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.000
Yes, I think that would be fair to say. Yes.

721
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.080
Mmm.

722
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.600
Did he engineer the leaking of the e-mail that led to your resignation?

723
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.720
Er, well, I don't have any solid evidence

724
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.520
that he did that. Um...

725
00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.760
MOBILE RINGS

726
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.720
Sounds like somebody else's career has just gone into the shredder!

727
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.760
I have asked for all mobile phones to be turned completely off, please.

728
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.280
I'm sorry, Mrs Murray.

729
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.480
Yes, it is...

730
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.000
Mr Hodge.

731
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.680
Mrs Murray, we spoke earlier about your husband's interests

732
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.400
in the key worker, er, housing sell off.

733
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.080
Yes, we spoke about his lack of interest in fact, to be precise.

734
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.600
Yes, well, I've no wish to retread that particular ground.

735
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.800
No, I've no wish to either,

736
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.080
I mean, I really do want to make that quite clear.

737
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.160
I'm finding this constant reiteration of my husband's, er,

738
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.000
innocent position to be wearing in the extreme.

739
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.200
Mrs Murray, may I remind you

740
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.600
that you did ask for this inquiry to be set up.

741
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.800
I didn't not want an inquiry.

742
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.920
Well, presumably there was something that you feel that needed

743
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.000
to be said, needed to be asked, about, er, about PFI, about leaking.

744
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.520
I think, er, that it's a good idea to have an inquiry

745
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.920
every now and then. I just think it, um...

746
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.840
Livens things up a bit.

747
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.720
On that subject, was it, um,

748
00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:00.760
Mr Tucker who persuaded you call for an inquiry into Mr Tickel's death?

749
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.600
Er, I called for the inquiry

750
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.000
after Mr Tucker had spoken to me.

751
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.240
Is there a better party happening elsewhere?

752
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.920
I'm sorry Mrs Murray, in view of events developing

753
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.280
outside of this room, some of which may be subject to police

754
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.200
investigations, and consequently to re-examine the parameters

755
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.000
of this inquiry, I think we'll leave it there for the moment, Mrs Murray.

756
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.960
Well, yeah, I have actually prepared a very brief statement,

757
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.040
which I think will clarify my position on...

758
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.840
I'm afraid we don't have the time for that.

759
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.920
It is very brief. Um, I think it was Gandhi who once said

760
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.960
that an honest man is a gift from God and a gift to...

761
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.320
I'm sure a written submission will suffice. Thank you so much.

762
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.320
I'm now going to adjourn for a short period.

763
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.840
(Fuck's sake.)

764
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.960
Please be seated. Thank you for your attendance, Ms Murdoch.

765
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.320
Um, Mr Weir has some questions.

766
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.800
If I can turn to you, Ms Murdoch.

767
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.120
How would you describe your relationship with Ms Coverley?

768
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.520
Do you, do you get on well with her, with her?

769
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.600
No.

770
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.280
Can you, um... Can you expand on that for us a little?

771
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.960
No.

772
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.440
I do not...

773
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.680
..get on with her.

774
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.680
Um, we do not get on.

775
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.880
I think we do!

776
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.680
There may have been times when we do get on, and have got on.

777
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.040
Um, I do not recall to that. Thank you.

778
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.680
Ms Coverley, you compared Ms Murdoch to a dog and described her as weak

779
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.800
in our last interview.

780
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.320
Yeah, er, I like, I like weak dogs, I have, I have one myself, so...

781
00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.440
Would you say that there is a culture of bullying within DoSAC?

782
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.240
If I could ask you first, Ms Murdoch.

783
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.560
Um, I'd say there was a culture of bullying ME at DoSAC.

784
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.400
You've experienced bullying there?

785
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.480
Well, you know, I, I see them all standing around, you know,

786
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.440
chattering like squirrels on Red Bull.

787
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.800
When I ask them what they're talking about,

788
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.640
they usually bark a tea order at me.

789
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.680
Or, you know, or call me, er, the blonde bombshite,

790
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.880
if I can use that word, or some other horrible sweary thing.

791
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.440
That's the form that the bullying takes?

792
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.400
And if you refuse to make your boss's tea, you know,

793
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.920
they, they call you Mariella Shitstrop.

794
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.360
Or Flouncy Sinatra, which, which doesn't even really work!

795
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.200
And can I ask you both about the leaked Guardian e-mail?

796
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.240
Oh, yes!

797
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.160
Ask anything you like, I don't know anything about that bit.

798
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.880
Yeah, thank you, Robyn. The e-mail was leaked from my computer,

799
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.160
which is proof that it was not me that sent it, um,

800
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.520
people do not leak from their own computers, that's not how it's done.

801
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.040
How is it done then, Mrs Coverley?

802
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.680
I don't know.

803
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.080
Well, you've just said something that implies

804
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.640
you do know how it's done.

805
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.280
I don't know.

806
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.680
How do you know, then,

807
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.960
that leaking is done from other people's computers?

808
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.000
Do you learn this from a leakers' charter?

809
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.680
Is it perhaps put up on a staff notice board?

810
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.840
Mr Glenn Cullen informed me.

811
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.440
He, er, he told me that if leaking is done, it's done from other computers.

812
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.760
Glenn Cullen.

813
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.960
Yeah, I'm not saying anything about Glenn Cullen himself, you understand.

814
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.760
You know, he is a very, very trustworthy individual.

815
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.600
Borderline priest.

816
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.960
No, Terri's right. I heard it was Glenn who did it.

817
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.360
No, I did not say that Glenn Cullen did it.

818
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.880
No, I, when I, I meant that Glenn told you, not that,

819
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.920
that I meant that Glenn did it.

820
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.120
To return for the moment to the subject of bullying,

821
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.000
where did Malcolm Tucker stand in all this?

822
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.960
The department's a horrible place, and when Malcolm was there

823
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.480
he was part of that, you know, he was the big bully.

824
00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.600
The other people are horribly rude,

825
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.960
and the rudeness is unnecessary, but, you know,

826
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.960
I don't get any sense that they've, they've got a big plan or anything.

827
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.040
You know, to be honest,

828
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.600
I think they're just trying to get through the day without

829
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.440
cocking up, and drink as many hot drinks as possible in the process.

830
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.840
Moving on, do you know anything about Malcolm Tucker's

831
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.400
involvement with data smuggling? Specifically private NHS details.

832
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.120
I think...

833
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.000
Er, no, no, I'm afraid we don't.

834
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.960
I don't. Um, would it be possible for me to revise my,

835
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.160
the opinion that I gave of Malcolm Tucker on my first appearance?

836
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.720
Your Lordship? Yes?

837
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.880
You may revise it, but of course it will stay on the record.

838
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.400
OK, um, well, I just wanted to make it absolutely clear that

839
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.920
having thought about it in the grand scheme of things,

840
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.000
I don't think it is fair to say that Malcolm is a bully or he's brutal.

841
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Certainly not when you compare him to some of his fellow countrymen.

842
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.200
Well, I think Malcolm's really difficult, and you do too, Terri.

843
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.120
Don't know why you're being so coy. It's not like he'll do a...you know.

844
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.720
A you know? What's, what's this?

845
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.000
You know, that story about you in the papers.

846
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.640
A story involving me in the newspapers is not the subject

847
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.600
of this investigation, so we are not going to discuss it any further.

848
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.440
Now, er, Miss Murdoch, what about the use of data smuggling,

849
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.160
er, within government?

850
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.400
Do you know anything about that?

851
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.760
Yeah, loads. Um, there are dodgy people in the NHS

852
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.120
and the benefits office who talk to investigators all the time.

853
00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.800
Do you have experience of this? Yeah, I've been on the receiving end of it.

854
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.480
I didn't know that the notes your GP makes are available

855
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.280
to your local pharmacist.

856
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.560
I went to see my mother's doctor about her alcohol problem,

857
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.560
which is a private family matter.

858
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.880
Next thing I knew, it's all round the village.

859
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.400
Yes. And now it's all round the world.

860
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.520
Exactly.

861
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.800
She's saying that that's your fault.

862
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.880
How?

863
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.360
Oh.

864
00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.520
As you can see, Baroness Sureka is not with us

865
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.040
and will remain absent while she deals with the personal allegations

866
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.120
published in the Sunday Times.

867
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.680
This in no way invalidates the inquiry, nor does it compromise

868
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.920
the integrity of any questioning conducted by Baroness Sureka.

869
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.000
Mr Hodge.

870
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.560
Thank you.

871
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.640
Er, Oliver Reeder, you were a senior advisor to Nicola Murray

872
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.840
during her time as Secretary of State at DoSAC.

873
00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.040
Yup. I was, er, the senior advisor.

874
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.280
Good, and when Ms Murray became Leader of the Opposition,

875
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.200
er, you were also one of her senior advisors?

876
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.280
Yeah. Again, the, the senior advisor, yeah.

877
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.000
I see, and now you're a senior advisor to Mr Dan Miller?

878
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Yeah, yeah, slight, a slightly less pivotal role with, with Dan,

879
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.440
but part of a, kind of, larger pivot, really.

880
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.000
Mm-hmm, thank you. Er, well, Mr Reeder,

881
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.320
they say that in politics knowledge is power.

882
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.880
True, yes, although that doesn't mean that Carol Vorderman

883
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.400
should be Prime Minister!

884
00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.200
Or should I say Stephen Fry, cos Carol's just maths, but yeah.

885
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.560
You've known Malcolm Tucker for, for some years now.

886
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.680
Yes, I have, yes.

887
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.320
He seems like a, an intimidating person. Is he?

888
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.200
Er, well, I mean not, not to me.

889
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.480
No?

890
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.080
No, er, no, er, no, although he doesn't,

891
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.040
he doesn't suffer fools gladly, I think that's fair to say,

892
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.720
or, um, or clever people, to be honest.

893
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.760
So he's never, er, bullied you?

894
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.280
Well, do I, do I look like I could be bullied by Mr Tucker?

895
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.520
I could... No.

896
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.160
Could you turn to tab nine?

897
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.360
You'll find it in your, in your folder there, yeah.

898
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.560
Um, we have some, er, some quotes here.

899
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.160
Some evidence from several civil servants who, who all

900
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:51.080
independently suggest that Mr Tucker, in fact, regularly did bully you.

901
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.960
"Mr Tucker threatened to remove Mr Reeder's appendix,

902
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.520
"throw away Mr Reeder,

903
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.960
"and appoint the useless flap of colon as special advisor."

904
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.160
Yeah.

905
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.160
Um... Well that's, yes!

906
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.160
That's banter.

907
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.680
"Mr Tucker told Mr Reeder that he would have him smothered,

908
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.840
"eviscerated, stuff, fitted with wheels, and donated to an orphanage."

909
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.760
That's, what... cos this is out of context,

910
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.720
what you don't have there is my reply.

911
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.920
And so, you know, it's just him. And what was that?

912
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.320
Er, well, I don't remember what it was on this occasion.

913
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.800
It would have been, but it would have been a, you know, kkk!

914
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.240
It would have been a zinger, because I gave as good as I got,

915
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.120
so it's not bullying. Very good.

916
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.440
Is there anything about the leaking of the so-called PFI e-mail

917
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.560
that you feel that this inquiry should, should be aware of?

918
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.280
Oh, God, um...

919
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.040
I mean, um...

920
00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.760
I mean, to be brutally frank,

921
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.840
I'm, I'm struggling to remember here, but...

922
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.840
Well, please take your time. There's no hurry.

923
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.120
Of course, yeah, I mean I think, you know, what,

924
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.200
what you have to remember, in this instance, is that on the day

925
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.320
that all of that stuff took place, um, I was in hospital.

926
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.280
So I'm, you know, I'm cut off, essentially, I didn't have a phone.

927
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.160
But I mean, I hadn't mentioned, er, the use of a phone, I mean...

928
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.640
Yes, no, I know, I'm simply saying I was...

929
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.440
You weren't working remotely from the hospital?

930
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.800
No, no, not remotely, um, er, in, in either sense. No. No.

931
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.480
Did you have any visitors?

932
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.520
Erm...

933
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.360
You must be able to remember that.

934
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.560
Well, if you're not completely sure, Mr Reeder,

935
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.400
you can always check with the visitors' records.

936
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.080
Well, don't, let's not do that, um, let's not do that for the moment,

937
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:33.120
let me just, if, just give, bear with me, er, but I did, yes,

938
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.880
I think I was visited by colleagues from the office.

939
00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.400
Can you give us a name?

940
00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.360
Er, Malcolm is, um, is his name, Malcolm's name,

941
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.760
Malcolm, Malcolm Tucker visited me.

942
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.600
I'm assuming this wasn't a social visit, what did, er,

943
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.920
what did he, what did Mr Tucker want?

944
00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.840
He wanted to, he, I mean, what, what, OK.

945
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.520
I mean, I'm really, I'm, I'm anxious, I'm keen,

946
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.240
I'm trying my best to answer your, er, questions truthfully...

947
00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.520
I should remind you you are under oath, Mr...

948
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.560
Absolutely, yes, I'm under oath, so this is... but, but, er...

949
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.800
What you have to understand is,

950
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.680
everybody has something on everyone here, right?

951
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:23.440
So in this circumstance, if you inadvertently say or do something,

952
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.480
um, er, you know, you shouldn't, then that's it, that's it,

953
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.880
that's it, it's done, your career is done.

954
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.200
You know, look what happened to a member of this inquiry, right?

955
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.160
So you have to...

956
00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.200
This is not the place to discuss those allegations. No, of course.

957
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.560
Mr Reeder, if you feel... Yeah.

958
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.960
You feel under pressure, am I right? Is that because of something that you know?

959
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.200
Yes, no, er, general pressure, I feel under a, a sort of,

960
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.960
just that, it's the jitters of work.

961
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.360
Who leaked the e-mail, Mr Reeder?

962
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.000
Glenn, er, Cullen.

963
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.920
Er, he was in DoSAC at the time,

964
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.720
and he, er, still had access to the e-mail, and he hated his life,

965
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.480
he, he, you know, he hated Nicola Murray because she'd previously

966
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.000
destroyed his chances of standing as an MP.

967
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.120
Most helpful, Glenn Cullen is our next witness.

968
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.520
Most interesting, thank you.

969
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.280
Oh, well, OK. That's fine, thank you.

970
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.000
Mr Cullen.

971
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.560
I wonder if I could start by taking you back to that time two years ago.

972
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.280
You left Nicola Murray, and you went to work for Fergus Williams.

973
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.800
Yes, yes I did, that's right.

974
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.400
And you found yourself in a coalition with the very party

975
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.080
that you opposed. That must have been extremely distressing.

976
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.320
Er, no, not at all, as a matter of fact. I was very invigorated

977
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.400
by the idea of, er, trying to forge a new way in politics.

978
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.560
Mm-hmm, so all was rosy?

979
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.560
Well, um, can't think of any negatives.

980
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.040
No friction?

981
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.600
No, the only F word was fun.

982
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.560
Thank you, Mr Cullen.

983
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.680
Mr Cullen.

984
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.160
Would you say there's a culture of leaking in the government?

985
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.520
Yes, I would. Yes, leaking and lying.

986
00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.320
To your knowledge have any of your colleagues lied to this inquiry?

987
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.240
Well, I mean, that's a bit like asking, you know, um,

988
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.760
does a cow drink milk?

989
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.760
Does it?

990
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.640
Probably.

991
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.440
But what I meant to say was, er, yes,

992
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.880
um, my colleagues lie constantly, it's a professional necessity.

993
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.480
Have you ever leaked, Mr Cullen?

994
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:25.760
First of all, may I just say, er, welcome back, Baroness Sureka,

995
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.760
big hugs, I'm sure I speak to everyone here

996
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.600
when I say that we're all thinking of you, er, and, er, you have been...

997
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.360
I'd rather you, um, swapped the ham-fisted flattery for actually

998
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.760
answering my question, which was have you ever leaked?

999
00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.960
Right. No, it's a very simple question

1000
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.200
and it's got a very simple answer. No, I haven't.

1001
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.240
Um, you'll be aware of Ollie Reeder's testimony to the inquiry

1002
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.200
where he said that you were, in fact, responsible for the PFI leak.

1003
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.400
Yes, I am.

1004
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.320
But, no, which means to say I am aware of, of that.

1005
00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.680
But, gosh, you've got to be careful what you say here, haven't you?

1006
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.160
You certainly do, Mr Cullen. Let's hope we're up to it.

1007
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.400
Is there any truth at all in Mr Reeder's accusations?

1008
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.760
Absolutely none whatsoever.

1009
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:11.200
He's talking out of his... out of his other cheeks, if you...

1010
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.480
Why would Oliver Reeder suggest that you were behind

1011
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.360
the PFI e-mail leak, then?

1012
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.920
I've absolutely no idea.

1013
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.800
It's very difficult for me to get into the mindset of somebody

1014
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.440
so entirely self-serving and, um, spiritually ugly.

1015
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.480
I mean, anyone who's been unfortunate enough to have come across

1016
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.400
Ollie Reeder will know that he is a genuinely...

1017
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.040
atrocious person.

1018
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.600
Mmm. Do you believe Mr Reeder was trying to cover himself in that case?

1019
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.880
Well, I do believe he has the emotional tools for the task. Yes, certainly.

1020
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.680
Do you believe that Ollie Reeder was behind the leak?

1021
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.520
No.

1022
00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.280
You see...

1023
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.000
A leak of this magnitude would require

1024
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
one essential item that Ollie lacks.

1025
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.120
And that's a spine.

1026
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:05.640
He is a man without a spine, he is a man worm,

1027
00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.640
he's a writhing mollusc without any strategies or convictions,

1028
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.240
he simply slimes his way into the nearest crack every night,

1029
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.560
and I would like to put on record that I apologise to this committee

1030
00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.240
for being the man who brought him into the world of politics.

1031
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.000
..the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

1032
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.640
Thank you for returning to this inquiry, Mr Tucker.

1033
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.240
That's no problem, no.

1034
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.120
I had a hair appointment, but I think they can fit me in next week.

1035
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.520
There's no need to be so flippant about this inquiry.

1036
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.360
Well, it's just, you know, you keep asking me the same questions,

1037
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.520
I can't really help it if you don't like the answers.

1038
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.680
Maybe you could try a little harder in answering.

1039
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.280
I'm amazed you've stayed at the top of politics for, for quite

1040
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.400
so long with such apparently poor powers of recall.

1041
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.520
Maybe it's my age. It's good to see you back.

1042
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.640
Thank you. Nice to see you too.

1043
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.680
At your last appearance at this inquiry,

1044
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.080
you admitted that you have leaked. Is that correct?

1045
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.560
Well, everyone leaks. Many, many people who appeared here in

1046
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.960
front of you, er, have leaked, but they've just lied about it to you.

1047
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.480
Mr Tucker, that's an incredibly serious charge,

1048
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.200
do you have any evidence to substantiate that allegation?

1049
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.760
Well, you will forgive me if I don't do your job for you.

1050
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.480
Because if you can't spot a sprayed-on halo

1051
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.360
while someone doing a, you know, "What me, guv?" panto act,

1052
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.720
maybe you shouldn't be sitting behind that desk.

1053
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.840
At your last appearance we asked you very specifically

1054
00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.800
how you came by Mr Tickel's NHS number and National Insurance number,

1055
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.520
and you could not recall.

1056
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.400
Have you had any more time to think about it?

1057
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.080
Yes, I have.

1058
00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.600
And could you tell us any more?

1059
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.360
No.

1060
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.960
You've got no recollection at all?

1061
00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.600
No. By the way, you should not be talking to me about this,

1062
00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.520
because you've been a victim of a leaking,

1063
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.600
a very unfortunate victim, and I have every sympathy with you.

1064
00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.360
How can you possibly give me a fair hearing when you've been

1065
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.640
a victim of the very crime that you are accusing me of?

1066
00:53:54.640 --> 00:54:00.400
You are prejudiced, this entire inquiry, therefore, is prejudiced.

1067
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.280
I can see what you're doing.

1068
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.640
It smacks of desperation and it will not work.

1069
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.000
Does it?

1070
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.040
No, listen, there you go again, see that's it,

1071
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.600
you're just rushing to judgement.

1072
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.720
You are totally discredited here.

1073
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.440
I am obliged to remind you, Mr Tucker, that you are under oath,

1074
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:22.920
and if you lie to this inquiry, it may result in a criminal prosecution.

1075
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:28.160
Sorry, please don't insult my intelligence by acting as if

1076
00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.480
you're all so naive that you don't know how this all works.

1077
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:37.160
Everybody in this room has bent the rules to get in here,

1078
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.360
because you don't get in this room without bending the rules,

1079
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.800
you don't get to where you are without bending the rules,

1080
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.640
that's the way it is.

1081
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.240
Mr Tucker, I'm going to give you one more chance

1082
00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.400
to respond to my question.

1083
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.000
How did you acquire Mr Tickel's NHS number

1084
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.960
and his National Insurance number?

1085
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.320
Who said I acquired it?

1086
00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.240
A photograph.

1087
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.080
No, no, the photograph shows me holding it.

1088
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.840
Doesn't show me acquiring it.

1089
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.120
You'd have to ask the person that gave me the folder.

1090
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.520
Who gave you the folder? I don't remember.

1091
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.800
You are being deliberately evasive.

1092
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.800
I...

1093
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.440
I don't...

1094
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.640
recall, you know. I don't, I don't know, I can't remember.

1095
00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.800
Very well.

1096
00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.720
Regardless of how you came by Mr Tickel's mental health records,

1097
00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.320
did you then leak them to the media?

1098
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.880
I can't recall.

1099
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.400
So that's not a denial?

1100
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.280
Je ne remember rien.

1101
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.600
Well, if you can't recall,

1102
00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.760
it leaves open the possibility that you did leak them.

1103
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.680
Let me tell you this.

1104
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.640
The whole planet's leaking, everybody is leaking.

1105
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.240
You know, everyone's spewing out their guts onto the internet.

1106
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.040
Putting up their, their relationship status,

1107
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.920
and, er, photos of their vajazzles.

1108
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.240
We've come to a point where there are people, millions of people,

1109
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.040
who are quite happy to trade a kidney in order to go on television.

1110
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.720
And to show people their knickers, to show people their skid marks,

1111
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.680
and then complain to OK Magazine about a breach of privacy.

1112
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.680
The exchange of private information, that is what drives our economy.

1113
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.480
But you come after me

1114
00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.280
because you can't, you can't arrest a land mass, can you?

1115
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.200
You can't, you can't cuff a country.

1116
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.920
You might as well just go and go,

1117
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.360
you can't lynch that guy there, can you?

1118
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.600
But you decide that you can sit there, you can judge,

1119
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.960
and you can ogle me like a Page Three girl.

1120
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.440
You don't like it? Well, you don't like yourself.

1121
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.440
You don't like your species, and you know what?

1122
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.480
Neither do I, but how dare you come and lay this at my door.

1123
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.880
How dare you blame me for this.

1124
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.440
Which is the result of a political class...

1125
00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.640
..which has given up on morality.

1126
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.080
And simply pursues popularity at all costs.

1127
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.720
I am you, and you are me.

1128
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:23.240
Are you finished?

1129
00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.560
Ah, I'm finished anyway.

1130
00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.720
You didn't finish me.

1131
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.120
Would you like to stand down?

1132
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.600
Thanks.

1133
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.280
Are you not the human router?

1134
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.760
The human router, yes.

1135
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.280
But I think you'll find that leaking is very much a 3G business.

1136
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.960
You know? It's, it's off the house wi-fi grid.

1137
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.320
I assume you're referring to the leaking of Mr Tickel's

1138
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.200
medical records, and I would like to say, I find that disgraceful,

1139
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.240
and I would like that on the record.

1140
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.680
Everything we say here is on the record,

1141
00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.840
Mr Williams, that's how this works.

1142
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.920
Well, that's great.

1143
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.120
When I was a journalist, OK, when I, when I was a journalist at the Mail, I used leaks.

1144
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.440
Now I'm in government, I do not leak.

1145
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.320
Wayne Rooney, for example, he used to score goals for Everton.

1146
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.320
And now he plays for, for Manchester United.

1147
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.960
Now, nobody expects him to score goals for Everton any more, do they?

1148
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.200
I mean, if he did that, United would give him the sack.

1149
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.640
..although you did previously describe yourself as a shepherdess.

1150
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.480
Now, did you have something to add to that?

1151
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.040
I just, shepherdess, did she say, did you say shepherdess?

1152
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.960
Yes, I was, I was giving an analogy, I mean to be, to be fair,

1153
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.400
Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe myself

1154
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.920
as a sheep in shepherdess's clothing.

1155
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.200
Do you follow?

1156
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.320
Err, no, not, not, er, completely. No.

1157
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.720
The shepherdess analogy is flawed anyway.

1158
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.000
Malcolm Tucker is very much a political Flintstone. You know.

1159
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.520
He carved his press releases into stone tablets.

1160
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.480
He uses a bird's beak to play his Happy Monday vinyls. He leaks.
