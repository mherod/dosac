00:02.000 --> 00:03.880
This programme
contains strong language

00:03.880 --> 00:05.840
The Prime Minister just has resigned!

00:05.840 --> 00:08.880
This is all down to you.
You're a Nutter. I am not a Nutter.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.560
Oh, you are going Nutter, mate.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.600
They'll be bobbing about
like Emperor penguins
trying to swap over an egg.

00:14.600 --> 00:19.200
Hello, Hugh? I know you're
not a Nutter, but you're not seen
as being not a Nutter either.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.640
I mean, are you with me?

00:20.640 --> 00:23.720
Goodbye and thanks
for all the varicose veins(!)

00:23.720 --> 00:25.160
Where's your pal Ben Swain?

00:25.160 --> 00:27.160
Morning. Oh, what a sad day.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.400
Yes, it is.
So, are you interested in...?

00:29.400 --> 00:31.760
Yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah.
I mean...

00:33.280 --> 00:36.200
But my first loyalty,
obviously, is to Hugh. Naturally.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.880
Mr Ben Swain,
my main man, the Swain man.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.640
Yeah, no,
I just told them I was

00:41.640 --> 00:45.000
popping out for a sandwich,
which I was in fact and still am.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.080
Listen, that,
that is the sound of my teeth.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.520
What, already?

00:50.520 --> 00:52.560
You're in a huddle with Tom NOW?

00:52.560 --> 00:54.520
Of course I want in!

00:54.520 --> 00:57.480
Well, yeah, absolutely.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.480
Well, you're my man, aren't you?

00:57.480 --> 01:02.440
You're the Ben, you're THE Ben.
You know you're, you're Ben Nevis,
Bentley Hill, you know?

01:02.440 --> 01:07.160
I was thinking, this is just
like election night, but
we know that we've won already.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.920
I want to see what's being said, OK?

01:09.920 --> 01:15.800
Hugh, come on.
Ah, Hugh, you're on the plane?

01:15.800 --> 01:19.080
How long have you been in the air?
Calling you from the plane?

01:19.080 --> 01:21.000
He's not saying he loves you, is he?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.800
Hello, Hugh?

01:22.800 --> 01:25.920
He's gone. He didn't say, let's
roll, did he? That'd be really bad.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.600
Thanks, Ollie.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.240
Dr Mamood at 12:15, yeah,
and that's a scrape and a polish
and everything else, lovely.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.280
Nick, Mr Hanway. Good afternoon.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.640
Yes, how are you?
No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:37.640 --> 01:44.000
Everything here is a little bit odd,
you know, little bit bob tod,
but, um... Ah, the Hughster.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.520
Yeah, no, he's always
been a very big admirer of Tom.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.880
So I don't see
why he wouldn't back Tom.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.759
PHONE RINGS

01:51.880 --> 01:53.759
Angela, hello.

01:53.759 --> 01:55.479
Ollie, how are you?

01:55.479 --> 01:58.320
I'm tickety-fuckerty-boo,
thank you very much.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.560
Sorry? Tickerty-fuckety-boo.
It's something that Ben says.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.280
Are you and Ben Swain big buds,
then?

02:03.280 --> 02:06.320
Well, you know.
Just could you, um...

02:06.320 --> 02:08.240
I'll come and talk to you.

02:09.759 --> 02:13.680
Things are just
a little bit fluid here and Glenn's
not really a big Ben fan.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.200
Ben Swain obviously, not the clock.
It's not the clock,
it's the bell that's called Big Ben.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.000
So go on, tell me,
who else is running?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.480
Well, no-one.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.400
No-one's going to stand
against Tom. He'll be unopposed.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.480
They'll be rebranding him as we
speak, I would imagine - new hair,

02:28.480 --> 02:32.360
Ted Baker teeth, all the modern
trappings of your political leader.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.760
Ollie, are you pissing?
Eh, no, that's the...

02:35.760 --> 02:38.360
eh, the flush
of the automatic urinals.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.040
It's a gentleman's lavatory.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.960
I don't want to talk to you while
you're holding your penis. Well,

02:40.040 --> 02:44.960
that's not what you used to say.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.320
Yes, it is. No. Well, actually it

02:44.960 --> 02:48.320
is precisely what you used to say.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.360
We're hearing that someone has
booked in to do a Today interview
to announce they're standing.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.560
Oh. 'You and big Ben
out of the loop on that one?'

02:57.560 --> 03:01.760
Eh, no, no, no. That's, um, sorry,

03:01.760 --> 03:06.200
that's, eh, Geoff Holhurst. 'Geoff?'

03:06.200 --> 03:08.680
I just can't
comment on that, sorry, no.

03:08.680 --> 03:14.360
I never know what to say when the
bloggers and the diary writers hit

03:08.680 --> 03:14.360
me with, "What about this rumour?"

03:14.360 --> 03:16.440
I'm not comfortable lying, Terri.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.320
Oh, for God's sake, Robyn. Bloggers.

03:18.320 --> 03:22.079
Tell them to bloody well sod off to
their grubby, dingy little bedrooms.

03:22.079 --> 03:26.160
Now I'm getting calls about
Geoff Holhurst, about him standing.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.920
About Geoff? Yeah.
Calls about that already? Yeah.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.760
- Geoff Holhurst?
- Yeah.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.920
For leader? That would
be extraordinary, very bizarre.
He's got such a tiny head.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.000
You're right.
He's got a miniature head.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.600
Is Geoff Tiny Head standing?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.400
Is he out in the cold?

03:40.400 --> 03:44.200
It's the last test tonight. Can

03:40.400 --> 03:44.200
we get a radio in here or something?

03:44.200 --> 03:46.520
Watch it on-line. What?
On the computer. Oh, no.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.760
It's like making coffee
in a microwave, it's all wrong.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.680
Tom's lot have gone into a huddle.

03:53.680 --> 03:58.680
Really, already? This is it,
you know. This is where it begins,
this is who's in, who's out.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.240
Have you heard anything?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.040
(Fatty is out.)

04:02.040 --> 04:05.000
Released to spend
more time with his fridge. Indeed.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.760
Has anybody seen Jamie? Why?

04:06.760 --> 04:11.120
Oh, don't tell me he's gone feral,
cos he was fucking terrifying
when you had him on the leash.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.400
Let's not overreact.
Easy for you to say.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.760
He threatened to shove an iPod up my
cock. Yeah, but you get that a lot.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.279
Malcolm, while you're here...

04:18.279 --> 04:21.399
Who is it that's booked to go
on Today tomorrow, do you know?

04:21.399 --> 04:24.680
We could find out.
It could be Bob Ryan. It could be.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.080
THEY LAUGH

04:24.680 --> 04:27.080
That's exactly who it's gonna be.

04:27.080 --> 04:31.440
Yeah, Glenn, probably Bob Ryan,
for fuck's sake. They'd
be going back in fucking time.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.640
Yeah, I believe Disraeli's

04:31.440 --> 04:35.640
standing as well. Oliver Cromwell.

04:35.640 --> 04:41.680
So, yeah. Yeah, a lot of fish that

04:35.640 --> 04:41.680
haven't crawled out onto the land
yet to form the first tetrapods.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.240
SILENCE, TELEPHONE RINGS

04:43.240 --> 04:46.600
I was hearing,
eh, maybe Geoff Holhurst.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.920
Geoff?! No fucking way.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.920
He's ruled himself out for definite.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.680
Mind you, I could always go and fire
a warning shot across his throat.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.480
What's that, is that Dan Miller?

04:55.480 --> 04:59.440
..about possibly standing?
That's something
I'm not prepared to answer.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.000
Ah. Ah. Very nice. Yes.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.080
You don't think
he's got a chance, do you?

05:05.080 --> 05:06.880
He's just a droid, isn't he?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.600
He's just, "drr whsst pu, pu, pu!"

05:08.600 --> 05:12.560
Hey, hey, don't, don't let him
hear you doing that sort of stuff.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.880
What happens
if he does stand a chance, hey?

05:14.880 --> 05:18.080
He'll fuck you harder than
Ron Jeremy, and with less warmth.

05:18.080 --> 05:23.960
Right, if anyone hears
from that little clip Jamie,
give me a call, yeah?

05:23.960 --> 05:26.120
Right, Geoff Holhurst.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.120
Yeah.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.040
What, Ollie's
our source on this?

05:28.040 --> 05:29.640
Ollie Reeder?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.560
Shallow throat, brilliant(!)

05:31.560 --> 05:33.400
Yeah, I know you don't rate him...

05:33.400 --> 05:37.440
Ollie Reeder is,
to quote Bobby Kennedy,
a complete fucking spasmanoid.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.920
Plus you know how Geoff Holhurst
photograph's.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.600
It looks like his body's
in the foreground
and his head is really far away.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.520
He looks fucking weird. Yeah.
Just something solid, OK?

05:46.520 --> 05:50.520
Otherwise our front page
will be an interview
with Janet Street Porter on why

05:50.520 --> 05:54.080
she hasn't been asked to be Prime
Minister and a giant fucking Sudoku.

05:55.960 --> 06:00.080
Malcolm. Oh, Elvis. Sorry, sorry
Cliff. Cliff, where are you off to?

06:00.080 --> 06:02.560
I'm actually off
to see an old colleague,

06:02.560 --> 06:06.720
you know, from the old days,

06:02.560 --> 06:06.720
from before you asked me to resign.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.600
Lovely. Look, I'd love to stop
and chat but I'd rather
have type 2 diabetes(!)

06:10.600 --> 06:13.080
Yes, fuck you, Malcolm.
Yeah, happy New Year.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.960
Right, hi, Geoff. Don't stand. Oh.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.000
No, no, I mean,
don't stand against Tom.
Now, do you see what I did there?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.400
I was both being funny
and also deadly serious.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.440
Where did you hear that?
Never mind where I heard it from.
The thing is, Geoff,

06:28.440 --> 06:31.400
you're gonna waste everybody's time.
I'm not standing.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.320
I'm trying to start a policy debate.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.800
About the future direction
of the party and the government.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.680
First, you've got no credentials.
You're so back bench
you've virtually fucking fallen off.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.840
You're out by the fucking bins
where I put you. Are you
listening to me? I'm not standing.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.480
Secondly, I'll tell The Mirror
about the drinking.
I'm not drinking.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.840
And thirdly, I'm gonna
tell The Mail about the affair.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.480
And fourthly,
you've got a tiny head.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.159
No, I haven't.

06:57.159 --> 07:00.280
Yes, you have. It's out of
proportion. Everybody mentions it.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.960
Look... See, you're shaking
it and I can hardly see it move.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.960
Are you shaking it now?
I can't tell. I'm not standing, OK?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.040
My head is
the right size, all right?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.680
It is very petite.
So you're not standing? No.

07:11.680 --> 07:16.400
Right, you will not stand against
Tom. I've said, I bloody said.
OK, thank you, Geoff.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.160
Let's go. Ariva-fucking-derci.
Let's have lunch some time.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.080
We'll have tete-a tiny-tete. Jesus.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.120
Oh, Nice Nutter Nick.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.000
What was all that about?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.320
Just, eh, you know,
putting out a fire.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.400
Definitely out? Definitely out.
Pissed out, steaming cinders, pal.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.680
Does Tom know you're here?
Yeah, of course.

07:34.680 --> 07:39.800
So how's the rebrand going?
OK. We've booked him
for a photograph on Tuesday.

07:39.800 --> 07:44.520
He's taking the family to
a Harvester. Oh, Jesus Christ,
really? Yeah.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.280
"Have you been to a Harvester
before, Prime Minister?

07:47.280 --> 07:51.360
"No, I've never been outside
the fucking house
with my family before." Anyway...

07:51.360 --> 07:55.760
Um, look, do you know

07:51.360 --> 07:55.760
the name of the bod who's booked
to go on Today in the morning?

07:55.760 --> 07:59.480
Sure, yeah. Do you know?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.120
Yeah, we just found out.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.680
So, you know who it is?

08:02.680 --> 08:07.920
Of course, I know. There's nothing
that you know that I don't know.
I'm Dr fucking Know.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.680
Who is it?

08:09.680 --> 08:13.240
Is this, are you testing me now?
Is it, cos I mean I could test you.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.520
And we could have a
big match or testostethon.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.440
How do I know that you've
got the fucking name anyway?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.280
Because Hugo at Today told us.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.160
Right.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.080
So what name have you got?

08:28.200 --> 08:29.840
Dan Miller.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.440
Oh, OK, so you do know.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.120
Of course I fucking do.

08:35.120 --> 08:40.200
Look, Tom's announcing his team
in the morning and I've got to stop
Dan Miller announcing his team

08:40.200 --> 08:44.240
two hours before we announce
ours, so if you want
to get on the bus that's...

08:44.240 --> 08:46.280
That is my mission.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.920
You, Mr Nutty Bar,
have given me a task.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.720
Jesus Christ, who the
fuck does Tom think he is?

08:53.720 --> 08:57.760
The next prime minister
of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, Malcolm.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.920
Nick, tell the mighty fucking Tom

09:03.920 --> 09:08.760
that his transition will be as
smooth as a Brazilian's fucking...

09:08.760 --> 09:12.160
Oh, Trinny AND Susannah.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.320
Well, I'm sorry to burst into
your little fucking boutique,

09:15.320 --> 09:18.040
but you've got a fight on your hands,

09:15.320 --> 09:18.040
that's all I'm saying.

09:18.040 --> 09:23.400
I'm backing a rival candidate, so
fuck you and fuck you and your Nutter
coronation, cos it ain't happening.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.800
So you're backing Dan Miller?
No, I'm not backing Dan Miller.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.040
Don't you fucking
ever ask me a question again.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.320
Fatty? Oh, aye, Fatty,
yeah, with his Spiderman pyjamas.
The fucking idiot.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.480
From now on it's a proper fight.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.960
It's a pub fight, Motherwell rules.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.640
And Tom is gonna get
a pint glass in his fucking eye,

09:41.640 --> 09:43.080
and a pool cue up his arse,

09:43.080 --> 09:45.840
and another
pool cue in his other fucking eye.

09:45.840 --> 09:50.400
Geoff Holhurst. Oh, what
Mr Baby New Potato Head? Fuck off.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.360
Hey, my main man,
how are you doing?

09:52.360 --> 09:54.320
Nice for the slice, big Ben.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.600
How are you? Good. Hi, Glenn.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.960
Ben. How, how's everything with you?
How, how's the huddle?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.760
What is the next move?

10:01.760 --> 10:07.880
The next move, my aged retainer,
will be...the next move.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.760
Gosh, I'm gonna write that down,
does it mean anything?

10:10.760 --> 10:14.040
I've got a few things to do here

10:10.760 --> 10:14.040
then I'm getting back to the huddle.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.560
Why don't you come over
to the hotel. Have a chat with Tom,
press the flesh.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.720
Step up onto the bridge of
the Starship Government.
Through the doors, Mr Spock, OK?

10:21.720 --> 10:25.200
Sounds great. We'll see
you there, yeah? Yeah. Kirk out.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.320
Are you a horse?

10:36.280 --> 10:38.280
Sorry?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.640
Are you a fucking horse?

10:42.160 --> 10:45.520
Um, I don't, I don't know
what you mean, what?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.200
Are you a fucking horse?

10:47.200 --> 10:50.840
OK, no, I'm not a horse.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.920
Are you sure? I'm sure.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.000
You've got a pretty fucking horsy
face, and a bit of a horsy wife.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.200
Are you a fucking horse, are you?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.360
OK, leaving the wife aside
for a second... Are you a horse?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.000
No. Exactly!

11:04.000 --> 11:06.440
I can categorically
say that I am not a horse.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.720
Exactly, you are not a fucking horse.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.680
You are no horse,
and you are not a stocking horse.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.160
Oh. You are the real thing.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.920
Oh, right.

11:16.920 --> 11:23.680
And we are gonna ram you up
Tom's arse so hard that he has
to shit out of his lying mouth.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.320
Oh, it's not a very
nice image really, is it?

11:28.320 --> 11:31.160
But, um, that's very motivating.

11:32.240 --> 11:37.240
Hello. Eh, could I just
put you on hold for two seconds?

11:37.240 --> 11:42.120
Hugh is, what, everyone says

11:37.240 --> 11:42.120
the fifth or sixth most influential
figure in the Cabinet.

11:42.120 --> 11:47.000
All right, the seventh. Just...
Geoffrey, can you just hold
on a moment? ..What is it, Robyn?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.440
Someone has leaked some
things about immigration policy

11:50.440 --> 11:53.640
and computers, and The Mail
would like to know what our line is.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.280
Oh, for fuck sake,

11:53.640 --> 11:56.280
that's not a priority, stonewall it.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.600
But I can't just say...

11:58.600 --> 12:02.560
Give them the cold cock, Robyn.
Sorry... What is the cold cock?

12:02.560 --> 12:05.200
Look, nothing is
happening on that tonight, OK?

12:05.200 --> 12:09.920
We've only got one fish fryer
in here and we've got a massive
political fish to fry, OK. Yes.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.640
Don't mention the massive
political fish
when you're talking to them.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.000
..Oh, some crap.
..Sorry to interrupt, um...

12:16.000 --> 12:21.560
Hi, Angela, um, well to be honest,
nothing is happening here about that.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.800
Yeah, everybody's at a standstill,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.680
so is that OK?

12:26.680 --> 12:30.320
Hugh's a, he's a figure of solidity,
isn't he? That's what he is.

12:30.320 --> 12:34.520
He's like, um, he's like,

12:30.320 --> 12:34.520
you know like WH Smith's, right?

12:34.520 --> 12:37.240
You don't notice that
it's there everyday, do you,

12:37.240 --> 12:40.320
but if it was suddenly gone,
you might just think, "Fuck."

12:40.320 --> 12:42.640
Ol? "..Where am I gonna get my pens?"

12:42.640 --> 12:45.880
Can I just... Can I... I'll
call you back, hang on, sorry, bye.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.400
What is it? Just...

12:47.400 --> 12:49.160
All right, Glenn.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.400
I'm gonna leave you to your

12:49.160 --> 12:52.400
switchboard duties. Fair enough.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.360
Don't worry about us here.

12:54.360 --> 12:59.320
Going back where the action is.
Don't want to miss a chance of

12:54.360 --> 12:59.320
getting into Uncle Tom's Cabinet.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.520
OK. Problems?

13:01.520 --> 13:03.400
It's, eh, it's Howard time.

13:03.400 --> 13:08.520
What is it? There's been a wild cat
walkout at Watford immigration
centre and whoever's been

13:08.520 --> 13:13.640
leaking has told the press that we
weren't prepared to spent money
on repairs for the computer system.

13:13.640 --> 13:19.120
The Mail have told them that this
department refuses point-blank
to do or say anything about it,

13:19.120 --> 13:21.360
and so the night shift
have walked out.

13:21.360 --> 13:26.160
Robyn, what the fuck do you
think you're doing? I cold cocked.
You said to. Jesus.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.720
I said nothing was happening,
I said nothing was going on here.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.920
Where did you learn that?
The civil servant school

13:29.720 --> 13:33.920
of telling the fucking truth(?)

13:33.920 --> 13:35.800
You said cold cocks. Well, yes.

13:35.800 --> 13:40.600
And get Ollie. Eh, right, I
want you to, to deal with it.
I'm gonna get back to the huddle.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.760
You, I want you to get onto
the press. I want you to
tell them I am, I'm all over it.

13:44.760 --> 13:50.640
Yeah. And I'm gonna instigate
a spectrum wide sweep of
every aspect of the, eh, the thing.

13:50.640 --> 13:54.600
OK. And that I'm not being
distracted by leadership bids, yeah?
Sure, no problem, Ben.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.680
I'll see you at the hotel.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.840
Eh, yeah, sure, but get this done.

13:58.840 --> 14:04.120
We'll see. Right, bring me back a
tiny wee Fanta from the mini bar.

13:58.840 --> 14:04.120
TELEPHONE RINGS

14:04.120 --> 14:05.400
Get the...

14:05.400 --> 14:07.000
PHONE RINGS

14:07.000 --> 14:10.080
Hi, Malc. There is
a glacier of shit at DOSAC.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.640
I need you over here
with a fucking blowtorch right now!

14:13.640 --> 14:18.160
And then Liam said that
someone suggested that Tom

14:18.160 --> 14:21.440
should go
on Strictly Come Dancing.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.720
He can barely even walk.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.760
He looks like he shat himself
the whole time. He often has.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.200
Right, listen up, where's Robyn?

14:27.760 --> 14:31.200
Here. Robyn, come here.

14:31.200 --> 14:36.920
Quick, listen,

14:31.200 --> 14:36.920
I'm bringing Jamie in to fire fight
this Watford story, OK?

14:36.920 --> 14:39.920
So you're working with
Jamie for the rest of the night.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.480
You take orders from Jamie.
You are going to bury
this Watford arse ache tonight, OK?!

14:44.480 --> 14:47.720
Because tomorrow morning,
from broadsheets to white rags

14:47.720 --> 14:52.440
I want page one, two and three
to be a profile of Tom looking

14:47.720 --> 14:52.440
like a fucking political colossus.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.920
You know, Tom meeting the Pope,
Tom in an NHS hospital
chatting to little baldy kiddies.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.960
I want pages four and five
to be a timeline of the last
few years in British politics,

15:00.960 --> 15:04.920
with me at the centre,
looking fucking indispensable,
and fucking benign.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.240
And I want page six to be
fucking Israel or some bullshit,

15:08.240 --> 15:12.080
not a fucking doe sack, dip shit
legacy distracting cock up!?

15:12.080 --> 15:16.480
Right, Jamie, look I just have to
say at this point that I do find him
a little bit frightening.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.040
Relax, he has never hit anyone,
or at least anyone he has hit

15:21.040 --> 15:24.320
has never had the balls
to take it to a superior.

15:24.320 --> 15:29.240
It's a fucking joke.
It's a joke, OK. The man is a
professional, you will be fine.

15:29.240 --> 15:33.200
Actually, Malcolm, eh, we
still have no word on Dan Miller.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.440
He's gone dark,
he's not answering his phone.

15:35.440 --> 15:39.120
Maybe he's in a hotel
with his own huddle. Ring around,
try and find him.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.960
What, ring every hotel in London
and ask if Dan Miller's booked in?

15:42.960 --> 15:45.560
Yeah, although he could
be using an assumed name.

15:45.560 --> 15:52.520
So you want me to ring round
every hotel in London and ask

15:45.560 --> 15:52.520
if anyone of any name has booked in?

15:52.520 --> 15:55.960
It will keep you busy.
You need to keep
the mind active at your age.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.480
You, walk my way.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.360
I need you to go over there for me,
I need you in that hotel.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.240
Oh, what, you're out of the loop?

16:05.240 --> 16:07.880
Fuck you, Andy Pandy, I AM the loop.

16:07.880 --> 16:13.040
I want you in for reasons that will
not become clear to you
for about 200 years, so just do it.

16:13.040 --> 16:18.120
Specifically see if any Dan Millers
are in there mincing around
in fishnets and high heels. Yeah.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.480
And I want updates every five,
right? OK.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.800
And listen,
get onto your ex at The Mail, right,
tell her no fucker is standing.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.720
They've all evaporated like
cat's piss on a hot tin roof. OK.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.360
OK, twat weasel, you got that?
Yes, thank you.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.200
Malcolm Tucker
is an investor in people(!)

16:33.200 --> 16:35.280
Yes, I heard that, fuck you.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.400
OK, the line is,
eh, wild cat walk out.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.280
We'll be talking to the unions.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.760
It's too early to comment.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.760
Off the record...

16:46.760 --> 16:52.400
union Neanderthals with
brains the size of children's bogies
couldn't take the heat

16:52.400 --> 16:57.080
of Hugh Abbott's ring stinging,
shit-hot public sector reforms,

16:57.080 --> 17:02.160
but he's flying back like Harrison
Ford with a big whip in one hand
and a skinny latte in the other

17:02.160 --> 17:06.760
and he's going to whip six shades
of shit out of them
and save the world, OK?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.680
OK, got that, "six shades of shit."

17:09.680 --> 17:11.760
So, what are you doing?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.920
I'm making a note of some of the

17:11.760 --> 17:14.920
things that you said to refer to.

17:14.920 --> 17:19.440
Don't take notes,
get on the fucking phone.
Start pumping the line, OK?

17:19.440 --> 17:23.280
Right. And don't look so scared, eh?
It's gonna be all right.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.920
I'm being polite, aren't I?

17:23.280 --> 17:25.920
Yeah well sort of.

17:25.920 --> 17:31.360
Well, exactly, so get on it, you
fucking hippie, or I will personally
have you as a light supper.

17:31.360 --> 17:37.920
OK, how does this sound, all right?
"After a period, out of favour
with the so-called powers that be,

17:37.920 --> 17:41.920
"I know what it's like to
feel the rough edge of this

17:37.920 --> 17:41.920
government's lack of concern..."

17:41.920 --> 17:45.720
Shit, Cliff, that is just...
self-pity and shit.

17:45.720 --> 17:50.080
Right, there is a germ
there though, isn't there?
No, it sucks cock.

17:50.080 --> 17:55.120
It sucks cock so deep
the bell end's wearing your
appendix as a little hat.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.440
Well, could you be a bit more,

17:55.120 --> 17:58.440
you know, specific in your criticism

17:58.440 --> 18:01.240
rather than a stream of abuse,
cos that would, you know...

18:01.240 --> 18:03.640
I think it's a bit defensive,
just a little...

18:03.640 --> 18:06.720
Hey you!! Virgin West Coast, shut it.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.040
You don't even know he's here, OK?

18:09.040 --> 18:11.600
In fact, get out of here,
this is an operations room.

18:11.600 --> 18:17.520
So unless you want your tonsils
removed by keyhole surgery with

18:11.600 --> 18:17.520
this fucking key here, piss off.

18:19.560 --> 18:23.440
Right, latest. Ollie says no-one's

18:19.560 --> 18:23.440
standing in Tom's way, definite.

18:23.440 --> 18:27.480
Oh, Ollie says, does he?
But the nutter's done it now,
he's our best source.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.320
What for, raw sewage? Ah!

18:30.320 --> 18:33.560
Right,
just start a Tom story, all right?

18:33.560 --> 18:37.920
But just as the spine,
don't elaborate. Just keep your
options open, all right.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.880
OK. And get rid of that
Dan Miller horse shit
and get going on the Tom.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.560
OK, people let's go, come on!

18:46.120 --> 18:50.680
Terri, I think you've dialled
the wrong number, this is not the
Samaritans. Yes, very funny.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.120
Listen, I've got something
for you, a bit of intelligence.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.280
Jamie has got Cliff Lawton
as his stalking horse.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.680
Who told you it was Lawton,
Martha Carly's gardener?

19:00.680 --> 19:03.480
Malcolm, it was Robyn who told me.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.560
Malcolm, are you there?

19:08.560 --> 19:12.520
Nobody gives a shit
if you got shafted by Malcolm.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.920
I will never, ever forgive
him for what he did to me.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.760
Jesus, this isn't EastEnders,

19:19.760 --> 19:21.680
this is politics.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.040
We're all on the same plate.
Cliff, there's no clean hands.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.440
TELEPHONE RINGS

19:25.040 --> 19:28.440
All right.

19:28.440 --> 19:32.840
Yeah?

19:28.440 --> 19:32.840
Jamie, what's that sort of droning
noise in the background, then?

19:32.840 --> 19:35.160
Here's a more positive approach.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.160
Try this...

19:35.160 --> 19:41.960
It's a boring kind of,
low sort of droning, boring kind
of miserably whining,

19:41.960 --> 19:45.960
boring kind of,
sort of boring noise going on?

19:45.960 --> 19:47.520
You've got it wrong.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.400
Cliff fucking Lawton.

19:49.400 --> 19:54.520
Hey, nice. Was the Cillit Bang
guy not available? Oh, fuck you.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.160
..To put it simply, I'm back.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.200
Oh, fuck off, Cliff.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.880
Sorry?

20:00.880 --> 20:02.800
Fuck off, you're a busted flush.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.240
You're not gonna be prime minister,
so fuck off.

20:05.240 --> 20:09.360
This is your thing, isn't it?
Everything has to be
an absolute, black and white.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.360
You know, I love you, fuck off.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.640
There are lots of shades of grey,
you know. Oh, I know that.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.920
I'm looking at 15 of them right now.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.720
See you later, no mark.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.040
No, no, no, he is a nice guy,

20:22.040 --> 20:26.280
it's just that apparently every
18 months, two years, he burns out.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.640
It takes a tug boat full
of Prozac to get him righted.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.640
They're here, everyone!
Team Cliff are here!

20:31.640 --> 20:35.240
# Uh-uh uh-uh-uh-uh
uh-uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh. #

20:35.240 --> 20:36.880
Fantastic.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.440
As if I would fucking
associate with Cliff Lawton.
I'm not a fucking joke.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.000
You've got this
Walford story covered, yeah? Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.720
You and I will have
a little discussion later. Yeah.

20:45.720 --> 20:50.680
I think Watford will get bumped
by the fact that we're about to hand
the nuclear codes to a guy who,

20:50.680 --> 20:54.840
every now and
then, loses it so bad he needs
Sat Nav to find his own nipples.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.400
What are you talking about?

20:56.400 --> 21:01.400
Well, I just thought it as fair
to let everyone know about the

20:56.400 --> 21:01.400
Tom rumours, you know, you know?

21:01.400 --> 21:04.320
How the guy that's
about to become prime minister

21:04.320 --> 21:07.280
chugs antidepressants
like they're fucking Smints.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.960
How the black dog humps his leg and
shits in his duvet every four months.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.080
I think that will bump
the Watford walk out.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.520
You've gone fucking psycho, son,

21:14.080 --> 21:17.520
fucking psycho.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.560
TWAT!

21:19.560 --> 21:21.720
The leader of
the Nutters is a nutter.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.080
Jesus, my niece is funnier
than that, she just
makes jokes about poo.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.200
No, I don't think that they'll
run with it, cos it's libellous,

21:28.200 --> 21:30.960
that's just as libellous
as the Hugh Edwards rumour.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.600
It's not my jurisdiction.
Nick Hanway looks after Tom,
not me. Thanks, bye.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.720
You're not dealing with this
then? Yes, I AM dealing with it,

21:37.720 --> 21:41.640
but officially YOU'RE dealing
with it, cos I don't
want to step on any toes.

21:41.640 --> 21:45.720
Everyone gets down now and again.
Loads of people take
antidepressants, millions.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.080
Yeah, your potential PM for one.
Oh. YOUR potential PM, not ours.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.720
Oh, look don't start
with the fucking semantics'
shit against, Tomsky.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.080
You know what I call semantics?
Wank.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.000
So, what do you say, we bury it?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.640
Are you asking me to manage this?

22:00.640 --> 22:02.280
Tom's not sure about you.

22:03.880 --> 22:08.640
Yeah, Tom is enormously
mental in the head,
as we've just been discussing.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.680
You might want to get back to base.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.400
Looks like your boss
is losing supporters.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.480
He's cracked.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.160
He's suddenly got subsidence.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.560
I'm getting a lot of calls.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.440
Well, you're Communications,
Robyn, that does tend to happen.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.880
Don't do jokes, Glenn, you're not
a funny man, you're not that type.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.880
Have you been talking to Malcolm?

22:28.440 --> 22:31.880
No, should I have?

22:31.880 --> 22:34.080
Well, who did you mention
Cliff Lawton to then?

22:34.080 --> 22:38.960
Well, only Terri. For fuck's sake,

22:34.080 --> 22:38.960
woman! What is your fucking problem?

22:38.960 --> 22:42.040
No, no don't answer that.
We'll be here all fucking night.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.680
Well, you were here all
fucking night.

22:44.680 --> 22:48.440
Hey, have you forgotten the key, huh?

22:48.440 --> 22:51.000
Oh, I... I'm terribly sorry.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.520
He's lost about 25 MPs
in the last 12 minutes.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.240
Let me tell you,
this is serious wobble.

22:56.240 --> 23:01.200
Christ, I haven't seen a wobble like
this since Fat Pat gave me a lap
dance. Does Hugh know about this?

23:01.200 --> 23:05.040
Yes.
This is the antidepressant thing?

23:05.040 --> 23:07.800
No, haven't you heard?
We're at war with Argentina.

23:07.800 --> 23:11.680
Yes, it's the fucking

23:07.800 --> 23:11.680
antidepressants thing. Jesus Christ.

23:11.680 --> 23:16.360
You're like some fucking
old computer that nobody
will take off your hands.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.920
You should be out in a fucking skip.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.840
Hi, Jamie, uh,
what can I do for you?

23:21.840 --> 23:23.720
I need you back here now.

23:23.720 --> 23:29.520
Oh, um... Well, I'm, I'm asking
nicely, but if necessary,
I could come and kidnap you.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.560
I do keep a balaclava
and gaffer tape in my car.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.360
No, I actually do,
do you hear me, Terri?!

23:35.360 --> 23:37.640
Right, how many has he lost?

23:37.640 --> 23:40.680
At least half a dozen.
That's all right though, isn't it?

23:40.680 --> 23:43.360
Still in the hundreds.
That's way above the 44.

23:43.360 --> 23:46.160
What does McCauley Caulkin
think's gonna happen next?

23:46.160 --> 23:48.680
Um, he doesn't know.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.520
Of course he doesn't fucking know.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.840
He's about as
connected as a kibbutz.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.680
Right, come on then, chop chop.
What am I doing?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.640
I don't know,

23:59.640 --> 24:01.320
just get on with it.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.160
HUM OF CONVERSATION

24:30.880 --> 24:33.480
Getting pretty tense out there.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.480
Yeah, yeah.

24:35.480 --> 24:38.480
So how come none of
Dan Miller's guys are here?

24:40.640 --> 24:42.800
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

24:42.800 --> 24:46.600
I'm Ollie Reeder.
I work with Ben Swain at DOSAC.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.040
Oh, right. Yeah, sorry.

24:49.040 --> 24:52.680
Bennie, big Ben, Benjamin,
min ya who, how you doing?

24:52.680 --> 24:54.680
It's all getting a bit, um wragh!

24:54.680 --> 24:56.360
God, in there, isn't it?

24:56.360 --> 24:58.800
Well, there's always wobbles.
There were last time?

24:58.800 --> 25:03.560
Fat Pat was just on the phone to Tom
asking him if he wants to withdraw.

25:03.560 --> 25:08.560
Are you pissing about?

25:03.560 --> 25:08.560
No, I'm not, not any more no,
so, so what, so what now?

25:08.560 --> 25:12.280
Fuck! No, she, she didn't actually
say that he should withdraw,

25:12.280 --> 25:15.960
she was just saying, he should
consider it, you know.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.040
Have you gone mad
in your blinky head?

25:18.040 --> 25:22.560
That's senior communications
telling us, "We'll just
leave that shotgun lying there

25:22.560 --> 25:24.600
"in case you want to use it,
Mr Cobain."

25:24.600 --> 25:29.320
So this is it.
So Tom goes down like the Belgrano
and we all just go down with him?

25:29.320 --> 25:34.320
Fuck it, if I knew it was end up like

25:29.320 --> 25:34.320
this, I'd have just spent my
time in a basement with Bjorn Borg,

25:34.320 --> 25:36.000
a bag of cocaine and some prozzers.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.280
KNOCK ON DOOR

25:48.280 --> 25:49.800
Come in!

25:53.080 --> 25:57.520
Oh, Glenn Connell, how
fairs the witching hour with you?

25:57.520 --> 26:02.800
Well, I've had better nights.
The one where my appendix burst
and my mother died springs to mind.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.640
What, on the same night?
Christmas Eve.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.040
Bloody hell, that's a bit steep.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.200
Why don't you sit down,
pull up a pew and have a listen,

26:12.200 --> 26:16.120
because this always makes the
world seem a slightly nicer place.

26:16.120 --> 26:20.440
Help yourself to a biscuit.
No, not for me. I don't think
these are by appointment.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.440
I'm supposed to be keeping
Hugh abreast of everything, but

26:23.440 --> 26:26.480
I'm feeling about as up to date
as the Gregorian calendar.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.000
I'm completely out of the loop.
Join the club,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.480
I'm having a bit of a
Robinson Crusoe moment myself.

26:32.480 --> 26:37.400
But, between you and me,
I'm beginning to piss myself
with excitement because

26:37.400 --> 26:40.320
(I've started to leak the
immigration figures to the press.)

26:40.320 --> 26:43.720
You're leaking? Mm-hm.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.400
That IS funny,

26:45.400 --> 26:47.360
Julius Nicholson, the wild one.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.880
I'm the new Che Guevara,
I'll just need a new moustache.

26:50.880 --> 26:54.480
And some
laser correction eye treatment. Ah.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.240
PHONE RINGS

26:54.480 --> 26:56.240
Hello.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.040
Right, well, well what's the plan?

26:58.040 --> 27:01.120
They don't have a plan. OK,
perhaps you should give them one.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.680
Well, yes, fantastic, because
obviously I have a very suitable one

27:04.680 --> 27:07.560
tattooed on the underside
of my scrotum, so why don't we...

27:07.560 --> 27:11.760
Shut it, you're using up all
the minutes on my "talk till
you get head cancer" tariff.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.880
Listen, get hold of Nick.

27:13.880 --> 27:18.440
Ask him if he's thought
about sounding out another body,
a safe pair of hands.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.640
Suggest Clare Ballentine.

27:20.640 --> 27:26.640
She's highly regarded, she's clean,
and she could theoretically
occupy the same space as Tom.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.320
Call me in three.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.800
Um, Ben?

27:36.800 --> 27:41.040
I've had a quick thought. Yeah,
go on, enlighten us, grasshopper.

27:41.040 --> 27:46.880
If Tom's dying, he doesn't have
to die, we can take his DNA
and transfer it to a healthier home.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.360
What are you talking about? This
is not a science fiction analogy.

27:50.360 --> 27:54.200
What I'm saying is why don't

27:50.360 --> 27:54.200
we sound out a potential fall-back.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.840
Who?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.760
Clare Ballentine.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.680
She's, she's highly regarded,
she's... Yeah, on the line. OK.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.480
She, what do you think?

28:04.480 --> 28:08.480
Um, to be honest, I was really
hoping that was gonna be shit

28:08.480 --> 28:13.440
because I'm tired and I'd

28:08.480 --> 28:13.440
quite like to hit someone, so...

28:13.440 --> 28:18.480
OK, where though?
My office in Richmond Terrace?
Yeah, OK, right, let's get there.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.480
Chop chop!

28:28.560 --> 28:30.160
So it's Ballentine?

28:30.160 --> 28:33.320
Well, it's a sideways move,
but it kind of makes sense.

28:33.320 --> 28:36.560
Shall we run with it?

28:33.320 --> 28:36.560
Well, it's definitely happening.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.000
She's on her way in.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.000
Is it gonna stand up?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.880
I think it'll stand up. You think?

28:42.880 --> 28:46.320
Probably. If you were me?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.520
I'd have a sex change.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.520
Very fucking funny(!)

28:50.520 --> 28:54.360
Right, fuck it let's do it.
Let's run with it.
Let's go, Ballentine story.

28:54.360 --> 28:59.120
We've got to run with something
otherwise we'll have to reprint
Hitler's fucking diaries again.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.800
There's a pack of them behind me.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.840
I'll be with you in about a minute.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.400
Is she on her way?
Yeah, yeah, Mark's got her in a car.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.600
Excuse me. Coming through.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.080
OK, thanks. ..This is The Times.

29:17.080 --> 29:21.440
They're saying they know
exactly how much the immigration
computer overspend was

29:21.440 --> 29:25.600
and it's a really, really big number
and they're throwing
lots of new stats at me.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.520
Somebody's leaking this stuff.

29:27.520 --> 29:31.080
All right, Terri, there's all
sorts of immigration shit hitting us,

29:31.080 --> 29:33.680
and I need you in here now
to eat that shit, OK?

29:33.680 --> 29:36.280
Lots of love, bye.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.440
We've only got one minute. OK...

29:40.440 --> 29:43.120
VACUUM CLEANER POWERS UP

29:43.120 --> 29:45.800
Nick's ready to dump
Tom if Ballentine's up for it.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.280
You have made me very, very happy.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.240
Yeah, you look it, I can see.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.000
There you go,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.960
like a herd of wildebeest
dressed by Burton.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.120
Stampede at the Debenham's sale.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.040
- Hello.
- What's this? What's this?

30:03.040 --> 30:06.120
What's all this carry on?
What are you all doing here?

30:06.120 --> 30:08.280
Listen, we've had a bit of brainwave.

30:08.280 --> 30:12.320
We're gonna float Clare Ballentine
as a possible.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.360
Clare Ballentine? Yeah.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.520
A great idea. Fucking great idea.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.080
Where'd you get that from? You know?

30:20.080 --> 30:23.000
Hey, Malcolm, Malcolm,
what the fuck's happening?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.040
Tom's in trouble.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.320
Good. His numbers are falling.

30:26.320 --> 30:30.440
Good. I suggested that they
take a look at another runner.

30:30.440 --> 30:34.400
What's going on?
Basically Clare Ballentine's
coming in, because, eh, Tom...

30:34.400 --> 30:36.560
Who's she?
She's a back bench MP.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.160
She did the, um,
what's that committee?

30:39.160 --> 30:40.520
What colour hair's she got?

30:40.520 --> 30:43.360
Orange. Is it relevant?

30:40.520 --> 30:43.360
Is it the woman with the freckles?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.560
The freckly lady...
She's lovely. Fine!

30:45.560 --> 30:47.560
Clare Ballentine.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.120
OK.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.120
OK, I'm not hating that.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.440
That's not total shit.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.160
Are you in on this?

30:55.160 --> 30:57.320
I'm not leaving it to you.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.400
You couldn't organise a bum rape
in a barracks.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.320
Au contraire!

31:03.320 --> 31:07.000
Tell me what's going on.
Well, I think it's
probably better if Nick...

31:07.000 --> 31:08.800
Nick called me in?! Yeah, he did.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.640
And what are you,
the late night coffee boy?

31:10.640 --> 31:13.520
Well, no, I... Hi, Clare,
thanks very, much for coming in.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.040
Thank you, nice to be here.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.440
Like the hair, Clare.
Oh, the hair, Clare(!)

31:17.440 --> 31:22.200
Ties with the look. Yes,
can I just get this straight,
it's three in the bloody morning.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.560
Yes, it is, that's true.
Statistically the time
when most suicides occur.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.840
The Indie had a pull-out
on self-harm.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.840
It said it in there.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.560
You know Nick, don't you?

31:32.560 --> 31:34.880
Yes, I know Nick. Hi, good morning.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.640
Morning. Ben Swank.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.640
Hi. I'm really sorry, why am I here?

31:37.640 --> 31:41.720
Shall we go through to
the meeting room? Let's get her
a little bit of privacy.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.640
Take a seat, take a seat.

31:45.640 --> 31:50.920
Tom's position is perhaps not
as crystal-clear as it was.

31:50.920 --> 31:57.240
And we have been tasked with
sounding out a possible alternative.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.880
You, Clare,
are the unanimous choice.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.400
You are very highly regarded, very.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.280
You have a fantastic track record.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.840
Canny operator. Tremendous gravitas.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.400
Good hair, yeah.

32:11.400 --> 32:15.960
Am I really the only person
you could think of to drag out
of bed at three in the morning?

32:15.960 --> 32:18.680
I've never had
any ambitions in this direction.

32:18.680 --> 32:23.360
Only cos you're not a careerist
or people don't see you as
some power-crazed Tibia.

32:23.360 --> 32:26.240
You're like a...
You're like a female John Major.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.200
No, but in a really good way.

32:28.200 --> 32:31.280
- That's a really good thing to be.
- Is Tom aware of this?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.640
Eh... Um, Nick can explain the...

32:33.640 --> 32:37.960
Well, between ourselves
Tom is not aware of that, so...

32:37.960 --> 32:43.120
Well, you know he must be aware
that something like this betrayal

32:43.120 --> 32:46.640
will be going on, you know, unless
he's madder than we think he is.

32:46.640 --> 32:52.680
Maybe, maybe, maybe he's dressed
as Pat Phoenix, wanking into
a desk tidy. It's possible.

32:52.680 --> 32:57.000
Well, on that delicate note,
I would like to say no,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.480
and I will stick to having been
captain of the Guides.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.040
HUBBUB

33:04.040 --> 33:06.440
Excuse me, everyone, everyone.

33:06.440 --> 33:10.800
Clare, is this a private matter?

33:10.800 --> 33:13.080
Eh, it is.
I knew it, it's a private matter.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.400
Excuse us, just through here.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.200
Clare, in there, in here.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.000
Who put the pit bull
in charge all of a sudden?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.960
It's a private matter.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.800
He's just following
his political instincts, OK?

33:24.800 --> 33:28.440
He's like one of them sniffer dogs
that we send after Semtex.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.560
MUFFLED CONVERSATION

33:42.880 --> 33:46.760
She is addicted to online poker.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.800
Well, could that play
in her favour, do you think?

33:49.800 --> 33:52.040
She used her own fucking name.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.440
Oh, Christ.

33:54.440 --> 33:58.920
Well, erm, thank you very
much indeed for your, erm,

33:58.920 --> 34:03.280
support and understanding
and, erm... I'll be off to bed.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.520
Thanks for coming in, Clare.
Night, night.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.240
Yeah, cheers... You're BUST!

34:07.240 --> 34:09.239
That's pontoon, mate.

34:09.239 --> 34:12.920
- Is it? Oh, right.
- Clare fucking Ballentine, eh?

34:12.920 --> 34:15.120
What a great idea that was.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.360
Clare Ballentine!

34:21.880 --> 34:24.520
- They've ditched Ballentine.
- What!

34:24.520 --> 34:26.480
- Already?
- Yeah.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.880
What the fuck is wrong
with these people, and what is this,

34:29.880 --> 34:33.320
potential leader speed dating?
Right, who is standing?

34:33.320 --> 34:35.800
- I don't know.
- Well, ditch that for a start.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.120
And get rid of her -
I can't stand her fucking face.

34:38.120 --> 34:42.040
- You should eat something.
- Oh, yeah, eat something,
that'd be right!

34:42.040 --> 34:46.560
You know what, our coverage so
far has either been wrong or
guesswork, which was wrong.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.679
So all we have now
is a story-shaped hole.

34:48.679 --> 34:51.080
Seriously your blood sugar's low.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.239
- Right.
- It makes you very irritable.

34:53.239 --> 34:57.640
No, what makes me very irritable,
Angela, is having no fucking stories

34:57.640 --> 35:02.960
and having to fill
an entire newspaper

34:57.640 --> 35:02.960
with just fucking prepositions.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.800
Could we have this conversation
near some coffee?

35:05.800 --> 35:06.880
- No.
- Thought not.

35:06.880 --> 35:12.800
No, this is a secret conversation
and I'm hoping that this time you can
keep the fucking secret cos normally

35:12.800 --> 35:15.800
you're as secure as a hymen
in a south London comprehensive.

35:15.800 --> 35:20.360
Yep, well done, that's offensive
on a number of levels
in a very concise way.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.160
- The leaks are coming from in here.
- What, in the gents?

35:23.160 --> 35:26.360
- No, the leaks are coming from
Richmond fucking Terrace.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.520
I want you to find out who

35:26.360 --> 35:29.520
the mole is, so we can play that game

35:29.520 --> 35:32.600
where the mole pops up

35:29.520 --> 35:32.600
and I smash it with a fucking hammer.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.600
- That is crossing the line, Jamie.
- Well, pardon me.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.120
Don't stare at the fucking urinals,
that's rude.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.640
I've never seen one before,
I'm quite intrigued.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.640
Yeah, yeah
for sure Ballentine's out.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.560
Thanks for that,
Malcolm, really appreciate it.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.560
Know what they're calling her?
Ugly Betty. Fucking brilliant.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.560
So it's a big night for you, huh?

35:48.560 --> 35:51.560
Well, yeah, you know...

35:51.560 --> 35:55.040
Right, listen, this Tom story, who's
got it? How are you gonna run it?

35:55.040 --> 35:58.320
You mean the vitamins?
Yes, the vitamins, ha, ha, ha.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.080
Probably nothing actually,
to be honest. Nothing at all?

36:01.080 --> 36:05.360
If he's gonna be the next PM,
I don't wanna piss him off with
something that can't stand up.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.080
Good call. I should
get you over here sometime, yeah?

36:08.080 --> 36:11.480
I'd love that. And obviously
if you do run this pill story...

36:11.480 --> 36:14.400
Yeah. ..I will personally

36:11.480 --> 36:14.400
fucking eviscerate you, right?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.680
Right. And, I mean,

36:14.400 --> 36:16.680
I don't have your education,

36:16.680 --> 36:20.840
I don't know what that means, but

36:16.680 --> 36:20.840
I'll start by ripping your cock off
and busk it from there.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.600
Good, thank you again.
Talk to you later.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.960
Cheers, bye-bye, now.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.680
He's a nice guy.

36:27.760 --> 36:32.560
Nick,
I've just had The Mail on the phone.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.960
They're running with the Tom story.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.280
It's not looking good. No, it's
good, I'm sorry, it's everywhere.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.200
Yeah. Spreading faster
than a rent boy's cheeks.

36:42.480 --> 36:46.840
We're gonna need a plan B here.

36:46.840 --> 36:50.240
Erm...

36:50.240 --> 36:52.760
What about Geoff Holhurst?

36:52.760 --> 36:55.680
Well, his head
photographs quite badly so...

36:55.680 --> 36:59.760
OK, um...

36:59.760 --> 37:01.920
Do you think

37:01.920 --> 37:03.520
Ben could run?

37:03.520 --> 37:07.560
If you think and look, you know,
it's up to you, Nick. Yeah, yeah.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.240
I can try him out if you think...

37:09.240 --> 37:12.920
Yeah. ..if you think that he

37:09.240 --> 37:12.920
will... Yeah, yeah. Let's get him in.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.720
Give him a wash and brush up,
we'll botox his eyes open.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.080
I'll get the press to stop
calling him Blinky Ben.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.440
Yeah. Yeah? As a matter of priority.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.640
So why have you got me,
why have you called me back in?

37:24.640 --> 37:28.320
Are we gonna do a post-Clare,
pre-emptive Dan Miller strike?

37:28.320 --> 37:30.840
We're thinking, Ben, um,

37:30.840 --> 37:33.440
about you. About...

37:33.440 --> 37:35.960
Sorry, as in me?

37:35.960 --> 37:39.880
People still want a Tom figure
but Tom is, is tainted, you know.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.160
But you, you're clean, y'know...

37:44.120 --> 37:45.800
You're the acceptable face of Tom.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.600
Tom is analogue in a digital age.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.560
You are digital, Ben.
You are Digi-Ben.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.280
Erm... I think,

37:51.560 --> 37:55.280
I really think you could get it.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.080
I really do.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.640
I really

37:58.640 --> 38:00.840
genuinely do.

38:04.240 --> 38:08.040
Oh, shit-cakes. I've...

38:08.040 --> 38:12.560
What, eh, so I could be
like a younger sort of, eh,

38:12.560 --> 38:16.880
hunger, the hungrier, leaner version
of Tom, is that it? Not leaner...

38:16.880 --> 38:18.680
All right, a younger, hungrier Tom?

38:18.680 --> 38:23.040
That's it! I mean because there's
an army of people out there
who want Tom's ideas.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.520
You could bring those ideas but,
you know, without the dribbling.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.440
Ollie, Ollie-wally-doodle!

38:28.440 --> 38:32.560
Ben, Big Ben, throw the Benjamin.
Why, um, what's with the coming in?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.640
Things are happening,
the game is afoot.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.360
Is it a particular game that...?

38:36.360 --> 38:39.040
I'm just gonna go and
make some nuisance calls...

38:39.040 --> 38:43.920
Stop fucking blinking
or I will take your optic nerve
and strangle you with it.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.000
OK. You look after him, Ollie, OK?
He's a very important man.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.360
Cock like a caber. What's um...

38:49.360 --> 38:53.920
You see Malcolm thinks I've got
a shot, more than just a shot.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.160
At the leadership?

38:56.160 --> 38:59.520
Yeah, I'm Digi-Ben.

38:59.520 --> 39:03.040
Great. Malcolm's taking some

38:59.520 --> 39:03.040
soundings, but this is it, you know.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.760
Do you want a pre meeting?
Do you want to be part of Team Ben,
the B team?

39:06.760 --> 39:08.680
The B team?

39:06.760 --> 39:08.680
The A team, call it that.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.120
I'd love to, Ben. Yeah, OK.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.600
Big Ben now. Hey! Ben Ladin.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.480
No, not that Ben. No, not that, OK.
Let's go. Yeah.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.080
I hope you've made this strong,
Robyn.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.640
There's no bloody milk.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.480
- Oh, forget the milk.
- There's no...huh!

39:25.480 --> 39:27.600
It doesn't matter. Forget it.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.440
- Cos I'm not going out.
- Forget it.

39:29.440 --> 39:33.520
Now I will deal with the press stuff
and you can find out who's been,
um, leaking.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.720
What? Well, I can't!

39:35.720 --> 39:37.600
I mean, that's not the...

39:37.600 --> 39:39.680
- That's spying.
- Yes, Robyn.

39:39.680 --> 39:43.520
I think you'll find that
in my job description
it doesn't include spying.

39:43.520 --> 39:47.760
Are we going to have to have, um,
the attitude conversation again,

39:43.520 --> 39:47.760
Robyn?

39:47.760 --> 39:50.760
- But that's YOUR attitude.
- Are we?

39:50.760 --> 39:53.960
Hey, desperate housewives,
found out who's leaking yet?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.000
I have.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.280
It's Julius. He's just told me.
Wait, wait, no, what I...

40:00.280 --> 40:02.920
Julius?! Yeah... Nicholson?!

40:02.920 --> 40:04.800
That baldy pussy.

40:04.800 --> 40:09.120
Well, if he thinks he's leaking now,
wait till you see him
when I'm finished with him.

40:09.120 --> 40:14.400
He'll look like fucking Mel Gibson's
Jesus. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

40:15.680 --> 40:16.720
Oh, dear.

40:16.720 --> 40:21.160
Yeah, Ben Swain, Angela.
Young but he's heavyweight.
He's the heavyweight of hope.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.880
Heavyweight of hope?
Yeah, don't put that.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.880
We might rethink that.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.400
But honey, I need to talk to the big
man. Can you put me through to Adam?

40:28.400 --> 40:32.800
Why? Because I'm ascending into
the political fuck-off-osphere,

40:32.800 --> 40:36.040
Angela, that's why. Yeah, well
he's busy. He'll call you back.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.840
Oh, look it's the little
turncoat in Richmond Terrace.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.240
Going back to the hotel
and the plotters, are we?

40:42.240 --> 40:44.400
Nobody's plotting anything, Glenn.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.400
It's just a...
Ooh, hello, the Golden Girls.
The party's hotting up.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.120
I'm listening to the test match,
just going to get some biscuits.

40:52.120 --> 40:56.960
Look at you both, hanging round like
a couple of school secretaries in
the summer holiday, nothing to do.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.000
Well,
the reason I'm not doing anything,

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
is you were meant to keep me
informed so I could keep Hugh

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
abreast of developments.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.840
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
Glenn, it's all gone
a bit starey-eyed,

41:06.840 --> 41:08.640
twitchy, motherfucking
crazy out there.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.760
I hope the Nutters have
made you olive monitor or
whatever it is that you want.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.000
Why am I supposed to be
batting for Hugh exactly?

41:15.000 --> 41:18.800
Why am I supposed to be looking
after fucking Eeyore in
the lion's den on this night?

41:18.800 --> 41:22.800
What? Because
he's your boss, you little prick!

41:22.800 --> 41:25.760
No, seriously though,
it's all changed. Give me reasons.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.520
What is the point of Hugh now?
What's the point of you?

41:28.520 --> 41:32.360
That's it, that's the last straw.
We're finished. I'm done with you.

41:32.360 --> 41:37.280
We're over you, you fucking pond
life. Oh, no, oh! Glenn's dumped me.

41:37.280 --> 41:40.640
I'm gonna have to go home and gorge
on chocolate, get pissed on Cava

41:40.640 --> 41:43.040
and look at a picture of
you in your bathing trunks.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.920
Little shit. Don't fucking push me,
Uncle Bulgaria!

41:45.920 --> 41:50.280
What are you gonna do?
Push you back, you crumbling
sandcastle... That's assault!

41:50.280 --> 41:52.080
..of a human being.
I can take you out.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.680
Take the swing for me.

41:53.680 --> 41:58.160
These are good biscuits and they
cost £4. Just take care, will you.

41:58.160 --> 42:01.360
For crying out loud, come on!

42:01.360 --> 42:04.480
Honestly.
Why don't I get something in?

42:04.480 --> 42:08.640
A man cannot live on Jaffa cakes
alone, obviously. I've tried.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.160
I could do with some food.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.960
Oh, what's this, feeding time?

42:14.960 --> 42:17.640
You on solids? I thought
you were still on the tit.

42:17.640 --> 42:21.040
I did order a curry
but I don't know what's happened
to that wee fucking Asian guy

42:21.040 --> 42:24.360
with a bagful of chapatis.
They've probably shot him by now.

42:24.360 --> 42:28.160
Malcolm! Not in the current climate!

42:24.360 --> 42:28.160
Get us a bit of cheese, will you?

42:28.160 --> 42:32.920
A whip cracking cheddar that even
I can still taste even after all the

42:28.160 --> 42:32.920
years of degradation

42:32.920 --> 42:35.240
I've put my taste buds through.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.240
Yeah, right.

42:35.240 --> 42:38.760
Right, come on, just a bit of cheese
for me and Dr Strangelove here.

42:38.760 --> 42:42.480
I'm a little bit busy here
to be honest, Malcolm,
to be getting cheese.

42:42.480 --> 42:47.560
If you don't go and get me some
cheese, I'm gonna rip your head

42:42.480 --> 42:47.560
off and give you a spine-dectomy.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.960
- Was he?!
- I'll just, eh,
I'll find out.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.880
- Ben!
- So you know when...

42:53.880 --> 42:57.000
Can I just check something,
you're not standing, are you?

42:57.000 --> 43:03.720
Terri, the line is, when I said
I wasn't standing, then
I definitely wasn't standing.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.360
- When was that?
- That was earlier.

43:05.360 --> 43:09.800
Right, so should it be somebody
mentions your name who'd be...

43:09.800 --> 43:14.080
Yeah, if somebody mentions my name,
then my name will be mentioned.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.360
That IS basically obvious.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.000
I would simply note my name was being
mentioned, an interesting fact.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.080
- One that would have to be

43:20.000 --> 43:23.080
factored into the whole...

43:20.000 --> 43:23.080
- OK.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.680
- ..matrix of factors.
Fine, no worries.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.680
- Crystal-clear.

43:25.680 --> 43:28.760
- If you'd excuse me.
- Fabulous.
- I'd say he stated the obvious.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.520
He's standing.
No, he's definitely standing.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.240
What's the news?

43:37.240 --> 43:42.000
- What?
- Just tell me what the fucking news

43:37.240 --> 43:42.000
is and I'll put it on the front page.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.800
It's not like we're The Independent,
we can't just stick a headline saying

43:45.800 --> 43:50.440
"Cruelty" and then stick a picture of
a dolphin or a whale underneath it.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.920
I mean that's just, that's just
fucking cheating. That's rubbish.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.080
Well, what I'm hearing...

43:59.080 --> 44:01.880
- is Ben Swain.
- Ben Swain?

44:01.880 --> 44:03.840
Yeah.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.920
Right.

44:05.920 --> 44:08.840
I literally don't know who he is.

44:08.840 --> 44:13.960
I'm not being stupid or anything
but I physically don't know
who Ben Swain is.

44:13.960 --> 44:18.720
He could be, he could be the leader
of the special boat squadron.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.840
Service.

44:19.840 --> 44:25.200
The special boat service or
whatever it's fucking called.
And this could be a massive coup.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.000
Ben Swain is what I'm hearing.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.760
Nick, good news, I've killed
the anti-depressant story. Oh.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.480
I've been on to The Mail.
They're not gonna run it.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.000
The wobble is over.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.720
Tom is now cycling with stabilisers.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.280
Oh, that's great news. How did
you do it? That would be telling!

44:45.280 --> 44:47.640
But you'll...
You'll let him know, yeah?

44:47.640 --> 44:50.720
You will tell the new Prime Minister
who stopped this, yeah?

44:50.720 --> 44:54.240
Cos, I mean, if you were to take all
the credit, well I might have to let

44:54.240 --> 44:58.760
him know that you were responsible
for starting this Ben running thing.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.200
Ben was just an option.

45:00.200 --> 45:05.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well just you make sure
I'm inside the tent pissing out.

45:05.280 --> 45:10.960
In fact forget the fucking tent,
I want a caravan of my own adjoining
Tom's with a big pissing veranda.

45:10.960 --> 45:15.640
Who's gonna tell Ben?
Cos, you know, this is pretty tough
for the big guy.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.360
Watch this, watch. OK.

45:17.360 --> 45:19.760
Ben, Ben.

45:19.760 --> 45:25.000
Where's Ollie? He's bigging me up,
floating me, talking to the media,

45:19.760 --> 45:25.000
on top of it.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.720
Yeah. Sorry. I've sent him out
looking for cheese. At six, yeah.

45:32.960 --> 45:37.200
Malcolm! Mac T, Macarola.
Have you tracked down Dan Miller?

45:37.200 --> 45:39.840
No, he's the nowhere man.
He's fucking nowhere.

45:39.840 --> 45:46.240
The good news however is that the,
eh, well, the Tom wobble, it's over.

45:46.240 --> 45:50.040
And so... That's great, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah! Why?

45:50.040 --> 45:53.280
So, so he's not wobbling.
What does that mean?

45:53.280 --> 45:56.600
Well, it means the rats are

45:53.280 --> 45:56.600
now returning to a very buoyant ship

45:56.600 --> 45:59.840
and they're playing deck tennis,

45:56.600 --> 45:59.840
so that's lovely, isn't it?

45:59.840 --> 46:02.600
What does that mean for me then?

46:02.600 --> 46:06.720
I guess that means
that you're standing in
the Chamber of the House of Commons

46:06.720 --> 46:10.720
with your big flaccid dick
hanging out, with a Vote For Me
sticker on the end.

46:10.720 --> 46:14.960
But you said, half-an-hour ago,
you said I was in with a shot!

46:14.960 --> 46:18.600
Don't fucking... Look, half-an-hour
ago you WERE in with a shot.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.600
This is half-an-hour hence.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.960
We've fucking time travelled, yes?

46:22.960 --> 46:26.480
We're in a weird and wonderful world
where everything is different.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.760
Maybe outside
the polar icecaps have melted.

46:28.760 --> 46:32.800
Maybe there's fucking
robots knocking about,

46:28.760 --> 46:32.800
and Davina McCall's Pope.

46:32.800 --> 46:38.760
Maybe you can download rice.
I want you right now to think

46:32.800 --> 46:38.760
about your future, OK?

46:38.760 --> 46:45.200
Think about what you are doing.
Get yourself back on the train

46:38.760 --> 46:45.200
to fucking Tomsville pronto, yeah?

46:45.200 --> 46:47.080
Yeah. Half-an-hour ago...

46:47.080 --> 46:50.600
CRICKET MATCH PLAYS ON RADIO

46:47.080 --> 46:50.600
There's no disgrace in losing but...

46:50.600 --> 46:52.560
Well, there's no disgrace
but still...

46:52.560 --> 46:55.040
Going like this is,
this is just, I mean.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.840
Oh, God, it's like a prostate
consultant's waiting room in here.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.680
OK.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.320
Right, wakey, wakey.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.160
Number one, I wanna know
where fucking Dan Miller is.

47:07.160 --> 47:10.640
And number two, I want to know what
the sneaky little tosser's up to.

47:10.640 --> 47:13.080
One, Malcolm, I don't know.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.440
Two, Malcolm, I don't care.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.280
And three, Malcolm, I note his stock
is quite high at the moment.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.880
So if I was a betting man,
I think he's a good bet.

47:21.880 --> 47:25.840
He's not a good bet.
Well, I'm a betting man

47:21.880 --> 47:25.840
and I think, let's bet on Ben.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.320
Don't tell me this.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.400
Oh, for...

47:30.400 --> 47:34.560
Now reverse swing starts to take
place. Oh, that is just perfect.

47:34.560 --> 47:40.000
Shut up. You're just a pair of twats
talking a pile of fucking bullshit.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.720
It's not bullshit, Malcolm,
it's the test match.

47:42.720 --> 47:46.640
What's that, cricket?
That's the English equivalent
of sport, isn't it?

47:46.640 --> 47:51.640
No actual physical contact...
just glaring.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.640
It's the cricket, it's the cricket.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
It's strategy, prowess...

47:55.640 --> 47:56.680
Have a prawn!

47:57.720 --> 47:59.640
Nicholson! Nicolson! >

47:59.640 --> 48:04.040
The immigration shit,
it was you, wasn't it?

48:04.040 --> 48:07.960
You mimsy-bastard-quisling-leak
fuck!

48:10.640 --> 48:12.680
- Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:12.680 --> 48:16.080
Yeah, you will be sorry,
you inflatable cock.

48:16.080 --> 48:17.720
You fucking sold us out, didn't you?

48:19.360 --> 48:21.120
Deny it!

48:21.120 --> 48:25.600
Well, James, I can't deny
something till I have the actual
charge presented to me.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.440
Oh, oh, oh, oh! "The actual charge."

48:27.440 --> 48:29.880
You mean apart from the charge
you're gonna get

48:29.880 --> 48:32.480
when I clamp jump leads
to you your baldy bollocks?

48:32.480 --> 48:36.840
OK, OK, OK. You, Julius Nicholson,
being of sound mind,

48:36.840 --> 48:40.440
but with a body that looks
like a giant sex toy,

48:40.440 --> 48:45.520
did knowingly do us up the shit hole
by passing confidential information

48:40.440 --> 48:45.520
to the enemy,

48:45.520 --> 48:48.320
and I am gonna have your guts
as a skipping rope

48:48.320 --> 48:52.600
and your lungs sun-dried and turned
into a little fucking waist coat.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.800
James, technically it was not a leak
because firstly...

48:55.800 --> 48:58.440
Eat that prawn!
..it's not confidential if...

48:58.440 --> 49:01.160
Eat that fucking prawn.

48:58.440 --> 49:01.160
I'm not eating prawns, Malcolm.

49:01.160 --> 49:02.440
Eat a bit of fucking prawn.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.240
Don't be stupid. Eat another prawn.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.920
Stop it. Have some fucking chow mein.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.760
- Malcolm.
- Stuff it in his fucking head.

49:08.760 --> 49:10.520
Stuff it in his big baby head.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.680
Get that fucking cheese over there!

49:12.680 --> 49:15.320
Eat the cheese! Go on, have some.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.200
Eat the fucking cheese! Cheese!

49:17.200 --> 49:19.800
This isn't funny.
This is an expensive suit.

49:19.800 --> 49:22.640
James, just...!
What the fuck are you doing?

49:22.640 --> 49:25.000
Hey, hey, hey, right!

49:25.000 --> 49:26.560
Eat the fucking cheese!

49:26.560 --> 49:28.400
Eat the cheese, Nicholson.

49:28.400 --> 49:31.400
They're gonna know about this
at the Treasury. Jesus Christ.

49:31.400 --> 49:35.120
Excuse me,
we haven't finished eating...
I don't care! I want to clean up.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.080
I've been waiting
for such a long time.

49:37.080 --> 49:41.320
If you want to clean then why not
just get in there and clean, eh?

49:41.320 --> 49:42.480
I WILL clean.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.480
Good, well, that IS your
job description, I assume, so...

49:45.480 --> 49:49.760
How dare you! What?
How dare you speak to me
in that manner? Look, just...

49:49.760 --> 49:53.680
This is disgusting.
What are you, a fucking lecturer
or a fucking cleaner?

49:53.680 --> 49:56.080
No, just clean it all up.
I don't need other people.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.360
I've got a room full of
fucking shit-sacks here

49:58.360 --> 50:02.440
who've given me enough arse-ache
all night I don't need you too,

49:58.360 --> 50:02.440
Mrs-fucking-Mop.

50:02.440 --> 50:04.680
I understand totally
that you feel...

50:04.680 --> 50:09.240
Does that give them license to
be rude? Absolutely not.
Make me feel like a small person?

50:09.240 --> 50:11.600
No way. Cos I'm not a small person.
Out of order.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.840
The world needs to know
about these people.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.720
They hide under things.
What do you mean?

50:15.720 --> 50:18.360
The world. What do you mean?
The News Of The World, The Sun.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.760
I don't think...
The Daily Mirror, the world.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.880
That's totally inappropriate.
Why not?

50:22.880 --> 50:26.040
Well, because it was... Because...
It's not an offence to you.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.360
Because.... Let me talk.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.920
Let me talk.
I don't like you talking above me.

50:29.920 --> 50:33.200
I'm not talking above you.
Neither am I talking down to you.

50:33.200 --> 50:37.080
Listen, Angela, how far have
you got with the Ben Swain thing?

50:37.080 --> 50:42.480
Why? Well, however far you've got

50:37.080 --> 50:42.480
with it basically that is too far.

50:42.480 --> 50:46.920
It's not happening?

50:42.480 --> 50:46.920
'I'm reverse floating him now.
I'm sucking him back up the pipe.'

50:46.920 --> 50:48.120
Hello?

50:48.120 --> 50:51.600
'Yeah, Adam, hi, listen, I'm really
sorry about the Ben Swain thing.'

50:51.600 --> 50:54.120
Yeah, these things happen,
don't they?

50:54.120 --> 50:57.840
They do happen. Do you know what
I'm gonna change page four and five
to now?

50:57.840 --> 51:01.600
It's gonna say, Junior Government
Gimp Wrecks Ex-Girlfriend's Career.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.640
How about that?
Do you like that? Yeah.

51:03.640 --> 51:10.080
Do you know what I'm gonna do, Oliver
Reeder? I'm gonna spend the rest of
my life dedicated to persecuting you

51:10.080 --> 51:14.760
in the most poisonous vendetta
ever known in the British media.

51:14.760 --> 51:18.760
How about that? You have a great day,

51:14.760 --> 51:18.760
you have a smashing fucking day.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.200
I've got quite a lot
of stuff I've got to get on with.

51:23.200 --> 51:27.720
I don't care. All I know is this man
was rude to me and sometimes I feel

51:23.200 --> 51:27.720
inside that I need

51:27.720 --> 51:31.600
to talk to somebody about this,
because I think there will be
a lot of people

51:31.600 --> 51:33.360
that would be interested to know.

51:33.360 --> 51:36.840
For every penny
you spend in the local shop it goes

51:36.840 --> 51:38.400
round the community six times.

51:38.400 --> 51:39.640
For every penny you...

51:39.640 --> 51:43.240
Robyn, are the phones
working OK cos Hugh said
he'd ring for an update?

51:43.240 --> 51:45.840
He rang about five minutes ago
to speak to Ollie.

51:45.840 --> 51:48.600
He asked to speak to Ollie?
He asked to speak to Ollie.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.840
Hi, Ollie. Go home, Glenn.

51:51.840 --> 51:57.240
Go to bed I would, you're just,
hanging around like the biscuit in
the barrel no-one wants, aren't you?

51:57.240 --> 52:01.400
Go home, Glenn, I mean,
you're like a spare prick at, um...

52:01.400 --> 52:03.680
A fair word. ..at a wedding or...

52:03.680 --> 52:06.440
Just going to the machine, anyone

52:03.680 --> 52:06.440
want coffee? Yes, please.

52:06.440 --> 52:11.560
You're not going anywhere, pal, I

52:06.440 --> 52:11.560
might need you. Fucking hell. Fuck!

52:11.560 --> 52:13.800
Jesus.

52:13.800 --> 52:17.400
I'm not a joke, OK?
All right, hello?!

52:17.400 --> 52:20.360
I am a man. I am a man, you know?

52:20.360 --> 52:22.160
You know?!

52:22.160 --> 52:25.000
This, this!

52:25.000 --> 52:28.640
This is my life!

52:28.640 --> 52:31.760
I'm a human being
and all this is MY life.

52:31.760 --> 52:36.080
And it's collapsing in front of me.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.840
Tom's lot, they're never
gonna want me, are they?

52:38.840 --> 52:41.440
And fucking Hugh, now...

52:41.440 --> 52:43.760
Jesus Christ, this is all...

52:43.760 --> 52:46.760
I AM A MAN!!!

52:46.760 --> 52:48.840
I know... No you don't,
I'm irrelevant.

52:48.840 --> 52:51.440
No, no, go away.
I'm irrelevant, I'm irrelevant!

52:51.760 --> 52:54.640
Fucking Hugh just wants
to speak to Tinky Winky!

52:54.640 --> 52:57.080
Well, fuck Tinky Winky!

52:57.080 --> 52:59.480
Fuck you, Tinky Winky!

52:59.480 --> 53:02.160
Auf wiedersehen, pet,
the party's over.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.880
Goodbye, yellow brick road.
What do you know about Hitler?

53:05.880 --> 53:09.680
Well he had a moustache and he
lived over there, fuck it all!

53:09.680 --> 53:13.400
Glenn, stop. Sit, sit down,
sit down. Have a cup of tea.

53:13.400 --> 53:16.640
Come on, pet, come on.
Fucking hell, Terri.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.480
Come on. I mean a whole career.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.440
I know, I know.
It's just over like that.

53:21.440 --> 53:25.800
One minute you're...
You're indispensable and
then you're just landfill.

53:25.800 --> 53:28.920
Mm, I know.

53:25.800 --> 53:28.920
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

53:28.920 --> 53:32.360
But you don't know! You've got

53:28.920 --> 53:32.360
a contract, you're a civil servant.

53:32.360 --> 53:36.000
Yeah, I know. No, you don't, you're

53:32.360 --> 53:36.000
on the last chopper out of Saigon.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.160
I'm having it up the arse
with Ho Chi Minh.

53:38.160 --> 53:41.440
I know, I know, I know.
I've just got to take this.

53:42.960 --> 53:45.200
I'm pretty busy.

53:45.200 --> 53:48.360
(Can you just deal with that.)
Hello?

53:48.360 --> 53:51.280
Yeah, can you hold on?
Malcolm, Malcolm! Hang on a sec.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.320
Malcolm, it's Dan Miller. What?

53:53.320 --> 53:55.720
He's in the building. What? Yeah.

53:55.720 --> 53:58.920
You could go for a run
because that releases endorphins.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.920
He's on the radar.
Dan Miller's fucking broken cover.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.920
He's gonna be here in 15
to see Nick.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.960
I want Jamie, I want Ben,
and I want you there.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.160
Get down there, come on,
I need you there.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.120
I need a man and you're a man.
Come on.

54:11.120 --> 54:14.800
He's coming with us,
he's a human being, remember?
Not your Elephant Man.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.440
Just get my phone.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.720
I'm gonna get back on the saddle.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.720
Get back in.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.560
Blood sugar, take that.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.160
Just answer the phone.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.320
OK, it's done.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.320
He's coming down in about a minute.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.000
Do you want me in for the Dan show?

54:29.000 --> 54:33.200
Depends who you're with, son.
Are you with Dan or with Hugh,

54:29.000 --> 54:33.200
Glenn or Ben or Nick?

54:33.200 --> 54:36.160
Make your mind up now.

54:33.200 --> 54:36.160
Sophie's fucking choice, who is it?

54:36.160 --> 54:37.320
Ben and Nick.

54:37.320 --> 54:40.040
Wa-hey, it's show time!

54:40.040 --> 54:46.440
Can Teflon Tucker save the Nutters
or will Dan Miller rip his scalp off

54:40.040 --> 54:46.440
and use it as an oven glove?

54:46.440 --> 54:48.760
Guys. Is he here?

54:48.760 --> 54:50.520
Dan's not arrived yet, has he?

54:50.520 --> 54:53.040
Laurel and fucking Hardy,
glad you could join us.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.920
You get that piano
up the stairs, OK?

54:54.920 --> 55:00.560
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for
the Right Honourable Dan Miller, MP.

55:00.560 --> 55:03.680
Ah, the reception committee.
What a turn out.

55:03.680 --> 55:06.600
And they say no-one's

55:03.680 --> 55:06.600
interested in politics. Malcolm.

55:06.600 --> 55:10.680
Dan. Nick and Ben.

55:10.680 --> 55:12.640
Jamie.

55:10.680 --> 55:12.640
Oh God, enough of the pleasantries.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.240
Let's just oil up
and get fucking, eh?

55:15.240 --> 55:18.440
So I'm...looking forward to today.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.920
Yes, today should
be very interesting.

55:20.920 --> 55:24.560
I was just wondering,
what are you actually gonna
be saying on Today?

55:24.560 --> 55:26.240
On The Today Programme? Yeah.

55:26.240 --> 55:32.160
Yeah. Well, I'll be saying that
I'll be fully endorsing Tom.

55:32.160 --> 55:35.040
Tom's my guy and he always has been.

55:35.040 --> 55:38.480
Really? Is that it?

55:38.480 --> 55:41.440
No buts, no elephant traps?

55:41.440 --> 55:47.400
No, no, no. Tom and I came to an
arrangement about an hour or so ago.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.520
Well, eh,

55:49.520 --> 55:52.520
my work here is...done.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.640
Why wasn't I told?

55:54.640 --> 55:56.680
HE WHISTLES THEN...

55:56.680 --> 55:59.480
BLOWS A RASPBERRY

55:59.480 --> 56:06.000
It's the sound of you flying
out of the loop, head-first

55:59.480 --> 56:06.000
into a huge mound of shite.

56:08.200 --> 56:12.440
So this whole evening
has just been a waste of time.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.720
Yeah, yeah, got it, got it.

56:14.720 --> 56:17.120
Yes, yes, that's,
that's pretty much it.

56:17.120 --> 56:21.960
That's why I went home and
had a good night's sleep.

56:21.960 --> 56:27.880
Oh, by the way, Malcolm,
Tom says to liaise with you
on the press and...

56:27.880 --> 56:30.720
Yes, yes, of course, yeah.

56:30.720 --> 56:34.960
MOBILE PHONE PINGS

56:30.720 --> 56:34.960
Oh, God. I've been summoned
to the breakfast meeting

56:34.960 --> 56:37.760
to talk to Tom about this morning.

56:37.760 --> 56:40.360
Some details about Clare Ballentine,

56:40.360 --> 56:42.280
Geoff Holhurst,

56:42.280 --> 56:44.960
young Benjamin.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.640
Fuck you very much,

56:46.640 --> 56:48.920
you unscrupulous bastard.

56:48.920 --> 56:53.760
Scruples, scruples, what are they?
Is that those low-fat Kettle chips?

56:53.760 --> 56:55.240
OK, people...

56:55.240 --> 56:57.600
Wake up and smell the cock!

56:57.600 --> 57:03.840
Ben, next time that you wanna
stab Caesar, make sure you're

56:57.600 --> 57:03.840
not holding a fucking plastic spoon.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.920
No, look I wasn't.
I was never gonna stand.

57:06.920 --> 57:08.520
Malcolm!

57:08.520 --> 57:13.320
The Mail's got hold of a story
about Ben being racist to a cleaner
and saying racial things.

57:13.320 --> 57:16.200
Oh, f.... Yeah and they're
gonna run with the headline

57:16.200 --> 57:17.360
Uncle Tom's Cabinet,

57:17.360 --> 57:20.760
which is a really big problem for us
cos it's a very good headline.

57:20.760 --> 57:23.880
I haven't said... I'm not a racist.
I'm SO not a racist.

57:23.880 --> 57:26.880
One of my best friends is an Asian.

57:26.880 --> 57:29.200
No, I know that sounds...

57:29.200 --> 57:31.800
You, that's it. I'm not
standing for that. It's all...

57:31.800 --> 57:33.680
You're fucking a dead man walking.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.720
You think I leaked this?
D'you think I'm seven years old?

57:36.720 --> 57:40.600
Kiss my bollocks, this has got
nothing to do with me. Was it you?

57:40.600 --> 57:42.120
No, it wasn't fucking me.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.320
Why would it be me?

57:43.320 --> 57:44.400
I thought we'd be working together

57:44.400 --> 57:45.640
in the new administration we'd...

57:45.640 --> 57:48.320
What, the new administration?
Listen to the First Lady.

57:48.320 --> 57:49.880
Oh, shut up, Glenn. Shut up.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.960
I've got it. It was fucking
Joni Mitchell, it was her.

57:52.960 --> 57:55.920
- Did you?
- I've leaked nothing.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.960
What?

57:56.960 --> 57:58.840
Other than the accidental leak.

57:58.840 --> 58:00.240
Look, I know that it was you.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.480
You're a pint-pot Judas.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.240
It wasn't me. A pint-pot Judas.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.960
I am five foot ten.
Well you don't fill that.

58:06.960 --> 58:11.840
It wasn't him, it was me.
Oh, fuck off, man, no way, no way.

58:11.840 --> 58:13.560
I've been leaking for 27 years,

58:13.560 --> 58:15.400
I know how it's done. I leaked...

58:15.400 --> 58:19.120
You don't leak. Well,
not from the mouth anyway.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.000
You fucking shut up.
At least this is Hugh's Glenn.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
All that you are, mate,
is fucking Ben's Glenn.

58:28.400 --> 58:30.640
Ben's Glenn?

58:31.640 --> 58:35.280
That's all I am. I'm Ben's Glenn?!

58:35.280 --> 58:37.720
What's wrong with being Ben's Glenn?

58:37.720 --> 58:39.160
What's... It's the Ben bit.

58:39.160 --> 58:42.640
You say that like it's a disease.
It's the Glenn bit, not the Ben bit.

58:42.640 --> 58:45.400
Right. You're Ben, you're Big Ben!
Yeah. You're Bennie King.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.120
You're...Ben Kenobi. Yeah, I know.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.040
Yeah, we're going places. Yeah.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.960
Well, back to the office.
