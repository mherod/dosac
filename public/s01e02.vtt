00:02.280 --> 00:06.960
This programme contains
strong language.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.960
You look like shit. I know.

00:06.960 --> 00:11.080
Margaret Thatcher used to survive on
less than four hours sleep a night,

00:11.080 --> 00:12.400
how is that possible?

00:12.400 --> 00:14.120
Monkey glands, and she was mad.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.520
This programme
contains strong language.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.600
And she lived
above the shop of course,

00:18.600 --> 00:20.200
so she didn't have to commute.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.080
I mean London is so big,
can't we devolve some of it?

00:25.080 --> 00:29.120
If I could get just one decent
night's shut-eye in the flat
I'd be able to cope.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.840
Look, Hugh do yourself a favour
stay over in the flat.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.240
I can't break my promise to Kate.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.480
I mean, do you actually
see the children?

00:36.480 --> 00:39.120
I don't have time for that,
all I do...

00:39.120 --> 00:44.120
I work, I eat, I shower - that's it.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.600
Occasionally...

00:45.600 --> 00:48.960
I take a dump,
just as a sort of treat,

00:48.960 --> 00:53.320
I mean that really is my treat,
that's what it's come to.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.160
I sit there and I think,

00:55.160 --> 00:58.760
"No, I'm not going to
read The New Statesman,

00:58.760 --> 01:04.280
"this time is just for me,
this is quality time just for me."

01:04.280 --> 01:06.080
Is that normal? It's sad.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.120
Still, at least
I've made something.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.240
Morning, morning,
Secretary of State,

01:10.240 --> 01:12.240
we've got quite a lot
to get through.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.960
Good. I have cancelled
that press interview

01:14.960 --> 01:17.240
for BBC Norfolk this afternoon. Why?

01:17.240 --> 01:20.480
Well, it was going to clash with
the two minute silence so I...

01:20.480 --> 01:23.400
Ooh, good call.
Yeah Hugh, not remembering the dead,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.760
talking
about benefit fraud in King's Lynn,

01:25.760 --> 01:27.560
you are gonna look a bit of a dick.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.320
Could you get me a cup of coffee?

01:29.320 --> 01:32.120
I told you about Waitrose,
when I was head of press,

01:32.120 --> 01:33.759
do you remember that? I know.

01:33.759 --> 01:36.360
It was a two minute silence -
an ordinary Sunday -

01:36.360 --> 01:39.560
and somebody said something
on the Tannoy about a spillage,

01:39.560 --> 01:42.920
the tabloids were like rats up
a drainpipe on Monday morning.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.440
Were they? Can you just...
It's The Times,

01:45.440 --> 01:48.680
could you just have a quick look at
that...? Is it about me?

01:48.680 --> 01:50.920
Why don't you have
a read of it first?

01:50.920 --> 01:52.400
This job is exciting enough

01:52.400 --> 01:55.640
without having to inject
artificial elements of suspense.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.840
You're cock teasing, just tell me.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.000
Hello, Malcolm...

02:00.000 --> 02:02.400
he hasn't yet, no. He is, isn't he?

02:02.400 --> 02:04.320
He is a prick. He is a prick.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.120
Who's a prick? Am I a prick?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.840
Yeah, rip the ball sack off...

02:07.840 --> 02:10.479
Whose ball sack? Whose ball sack?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.680
Whose balls, whose...
Hello, Malcolm.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.600
Have you got Simon Hewitt's
piece in front of you?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.560
I haven't quite been through it yet.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.880
Have you got to the bit where
he calls you out of your depth?

02:22.880 --> 02:25.240
No, at the moment he's calling me...

02:25.240 --> 02:26.760
"The political equivalent

02:26.760 --> 02:29.680
"of the house wine
at a suburban Indian restaurant."

02:29.680 --> 02:31.400
That's not very good, is it?

02:31.400 --> 02:34.480
Hang on a second, "insipid," yeah...

02:34.480 --> 02:36.640
HE MUMBLES

02:36.640 --> 02:39.320
"Uninspiring."
Christ, that's bad. Look at that.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.120
Ooh, "Disconnected
to the point of autism."

02:43.120 --> 02:46.040
We're going to get this tosser,
Hugh, don't you worry.

02:46.040 --> 02:50.440
He'll be at The Sport, photoshopping
the tits of Hollyoaks extras

02:50.440 --> 02:52.040
by the end of the month.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.520
Can I just say...? Hello?
No, he's gone.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.600
That's great, Malcolm's backing me.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.200
Yeah? So, how do we respond to this?

03:00.200 --> 03:03.040
Right, we don't...
we don't exchange insults

03:03.040 --> 03:06.040
with bloody
Simon-arsepipes-titty-twat.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.440
Is that the best swearing
you can come up with?

03:08.440 --> 03:12.560
This is a bucket of shit,
if someone throws shit at us
we throw shit back at them.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.840
We start a shit fight,
we throw so much shit back at them

03:15.840 --> 03:19.600
that they can't pick up shit, they
can't throw shit, they can't do shit.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.360
That's top swearing, Glenn,
well done.

03:22.360 --> 03:28.800
Watch and learn. I think we're all
agreed that the department
needs to look a bit less...

03:28.800 --> 03:30.840
Autistic... ..badly staffed.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.760
So, we need to -
at this morning's policy review -

03:34.760 --> 03:37.160
come up with some sort of new
announcement

03:37.160 --> 03:41.120
that's a bit more connected,
a bit more funky. Funky.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.440
Look, I hope you're not going to
just toss off some kind of policy,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.880
just to get back at some

03:45.440 --> 03:47.880
journalist.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.400
So, essentially this is just us
again,

03:50.400 --> 03:53.800
but in a bigger room, isn't it?
And without Terri.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.200
Yeah I've block-booked 14
meeting rooms, she'll never find us.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.760
It's foolproof, it's the only way
to get any un-interrupted work done.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.840
Chris from Health does
it all the time.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.880
OK, all right then,
I'll start us off.

04:04.880 --> 04:09.560
There was a key worker policy I
worked up a couple of months ago.

04:04.880 --> 04:09.560
Quite like that. Any takers?

04:09.560 --> 04:11.480
We need to find a good angle.

04:11.480 --> 04:15.680
Youths, you know, people are afraid
of youths, I mean I know I am.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.079
HE GROWLS

04:17.079 --> 04:20.800
Are you taking the piss? I'm joshing.

04:17.079 --> 04:20.800
It sounds like taking the piss.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.040
It's just good-natured joshing.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.680
My hand is in the air,
I am being good natured.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.840
Can the two of you just shut up?
Shut up for a minute, please.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.240
Where else can we go?

04:30.240 --> 04:32.240
Pollution, the environment?

04:32.240 --> 04:36.159
Litter? Dog shit? Aiming high(!)

04:36.159 --> 04:39.440
We aimed high and now we're at dog
shit. So, what you're...

04:39.440 --> 04:42.680
OK, I'm putting it about through a
number of cronies...

04:42.680 --> 04:44.280
Morning, Malcolm.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.880
..that Hewitt's piece was bollocks,
he did it as a favour to Cliff.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.480
Cliff being?
Cliff Lawton. Oh, right.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.360
Hugh's predecessor, they're as tight
as arse-cheeks. Are they now?

04:54.360 --> 04:57.240
Well, fuck knows, but that's what
we're saying, OK?

04:57.240 --> 05:00.720
It's personal, it's back-slapping,
it's borderline homoerotic,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.840
and you are the innocent
victim of a nasty media stitch-up.

05:03.840 --> 05:09.200
OK, right. Right, I'm fixing you

05:03.840 --> 05:09.200
up with a main man media piece
with your ex Angela Heaney but...

05:09.200 --> 05:14.200
it is a perfect opportunity to show
just how clued-up you are actually.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.280
Hughie Abbot, the in-touch guy,
you're on the ball,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.360
you know the price of a pint of milk,

05:19.360 --> 05:22.080
you love VH1, Pixar,
you dig The Streets...

05:22.080 --> 05:23.560
No, no, they're all great.

05:23.560 --> 05:28.480
You've got absolutely no fucking idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

05:28.480 --> 05:30.960
Yeah, yeah I do.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.800
Who's the only gay in the village?

05:34.600 --> 05:38.240
Eddie Grundy. I don't know, because
I know that he's got children,

05:38.240 --> 05:41.840
mind you a lot of them do these days
you know Ben at the Foreign Office.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.280
What's a chav?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.440
Ch...erm...
You must know this!

05:48.440 --> 05:51.320
Hugh, what is a chav?
A chav, you must know what a chav...

05:51.320 --> 05:54.640
Look just saying chav
isn't very helpful.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.280
This is important stuff, Hugh.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.040
Right, we do a weekly digest
for the Prime Minister,

05:59.040 --> 06:02.280
we boil down the week's television,
cinema, music, so on.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.520
The Zeitgeist tapes. Exactly,
it's EastEnders highlights,

06:05.520 --> 06:07.640
choice bits
from all the reality shows,

06:07.640 --> 06:10.040
ten second music videos,
that kind of thing.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.400
God that's why the PM also looks
so clued-up,

06:12.400 --> 06:14.960
I always thought
he was genuinely quite with it.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.880
He's as bad as you, he uses
phrases like "with it" as well.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.320
I'm gonna bike that over to Terri.
Watch it, OK?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.440
Listen, when you talk
to Angela Heaney,

06:22.440 --> 06:24.560
remember to stick the boot
into Hewitt.

06:24.560 --> 06:29.400
I'm putting it about that Cliff
offered him two weeks at his
Tuscan villa for that piece, OK?

06:29.400 --> 06:33.520
10-4, daddy-o. Hey, hey, hey, hey,

06:29.400 --> 06:33.520
hey. This is serious.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.400
You have got 24 hours to sort out
your policy on EastEnders, right?

06:38.400 --> 06:40.560
or you're for the Halal butchers.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.800
HE MIMICS THE EASTENDERS DRUMS

06:47.680 --> 06:49.280
Even he knows.

06:54.600 --> 07:00.120
Terri, two main contenders
for our policy decision... Right.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.920
Erm, we change Arts and Music policy
funding,

07:02.920 --> 07:05.840
so that we give most of the money
to the bad kids,

07:05.840 --> 07:08.520
give them intensive
arts and music tuition,

07:08.520 --> 07:12.600
stop them turning into, you know,
tomorrow's crims and offenders.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.120
And perhaps you'd
like to outline your...

07:15.120 --> 07:19.440
We punish the disruptive kids by
cutting them out of extra music and
arts tuition -

07:19.440 --> 07:21.760
show them the carrot
and the stick early on.

07:21.760 --> 07:28.280
The bad kids they get no money, and
Olly, the same bad kids, they get...

07:21.760 --> 07:28.280
More money. More money.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.320
They could both play, couldn't they?

07:30.320 --> 07:32.480
They're fundamentally contradictory.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.680
Yes, yes,
so which one should we go with?

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
Why don't you go with both or
neither,

07:36.680 --> 07:39.520
or come up with something else
completely different?

07:39.520 --> 07:41.159
You're being quite flippant.

07:41.159 --> 07:45.400
Well, I'm not, it's not,
it's not my role to have

07:41.159 --> 07:45.400
a preference, I sell the apples.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.159
If you want me to sell the apples
I'll sell the apples,

07:48.159 --> 07:50.000
and if you want me to sell oranges,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.520
then I'll go and tell people that
the apples, they're shit, Olly.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.800
I'll say, "Go on,
check out our oranges."

07:55.800 --> 07:58.760
Which do you prefer, you know,
apples or oranges?

07:58.760 --> 08:00.960
Apples. Apples.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.640
Apples. OK, thank you.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.520
Apples.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.040
Hugh, if we are going to spend
tax payers' money

08:07.040 --> 08:08.400
putting violent thugs

08:08.400 --> 08:11.240
into productions of
The fucking Cherry Orchard,

08:11.240 --> 08:12.960
we're gonna get crucified!

08:12.960 --> 08:18.400
Hang on a second. Terri, which
was apples, I mean, was Olly apples
or was Glenn apples?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.880
She's gone.
Let's throw this to a focus group.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.080
Why don't we throw this to a focus
group? I can run a focus group.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.280
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.360
So, this is where you've been
having these secret meetings, is it?

08:32.360 --> 08:35.080
Yeah. No. No. Well?

08:35.080 --> 08:40.679
I cannot keep abreast of all this.
Can you precis some of it for me?

08:40.679 --> 08:44.039
Yeah, sure. Well, I'll take
a precis of the transcripts

08:44.039 --> 08:46.480
and a precis of the press packs,

08:46.480 --> 08:48.600
could you precis the Zeitgeist tape?

08:48.600 --> 08:50.360
Check this out. What?

08:50.360 --> 08:52.600
A tape of this morning's
focus group.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.560
This is Mary, she is
a focus group legend, right?

08:55.560 --> 08:57.160
Mary? Mary she's called.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.680
Everything that she's said in the
last 12 months

08:59.680 --> 09:01.440
in every focus group she's been in

09:01.440 --> 09:03.480
has chimed exactly with
the core vote,

09:03.480 --> 09:06.080
and she loved my
Arts For Hearts And Minds policy.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.600
Did she now? Yes, she did now.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.000
Arts For Hearts And Minds?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Arts For Hearts And Minds,
that's what we're calling it.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.560
She said it chimed brilliantly
with stay-at-home mums, like her.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.520
She's really core
middle England, is she?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.520
Totally core middle England.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.840
TV: ..if children are put in a
position where they've got
a bit of responsibility,

09:24.840 --> 09:27.600
I think they'll rise to that
challenge, I really do.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.680
Art is all about
expression isn't it?

09:29.680 --> 09:32.960
Can I get her in for a sort
of one-to-one? Why not?

09:32.960 --> 09:36.080
Yeah absolutely, I can get...
Precis the focus group.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.880
Make it a bit more...focussed.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.800
Everybody else basically agrees
with what she says.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.400
It's a very good way to work,

09:42.400 --> 09:45.920
I like this, just cut out
all the extraneous stuff, you know,

09:45.920 --> 09:50.880
just the facts, man, you know so
just the protein, Atkins government.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.880
OK, I'll get her in.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.960
And in fact here they are now.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.480
Hello. Hello.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.000
Hi, I'm Mary.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.120
This is Mary
and this is Glenn Cullen.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.120
And this is Mary, our focus
group star. Good to meet you.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.360
Shown you on video. Thank you,
I keep getting asked back.

10:08.360 --> 10:12.040
You are one of the most, sort of,
articulate of our focus groupees

10:08.360 --> 10:12.040
now.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.240
That's, yeah...not groupie,
"groupees" with two "e"s.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.000
You're very kind, thanks.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.800
All right, well listen
erm, just to push on...

10:19.800 --> 10:21.320
I was thinking, that if I am

10:21.320 --> 10:23.520
representative of the public at
large,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.200
you know, you're going
to listen to what I say...

10:26.200 --> 10:29.040
Yeah, you're every woman.
"It's all in me."

10:29.040 --> 10:30.880
Yes, something like that.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.200
It's a song, Hugh. Yeah, I know.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.760
Right so, Mary, the policy that we
were talking about last time...

10:37.760 --> 10:39.600
Great policy, yeah, really good.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.640
Thank you.
Erm, what we were wondering about...

10:42.640 --> 10:46.400
I was thinking about it afterwards,
actually, it really stayed with me,

10:46.400 --> 10:48.160
and if those extra classes -

10:48.160 --> 10:51.080
the drama and the
music and the art classes -

10:51.080 --> 10:53.600
if they have them after school,
then it saves

10:53.600 --> 10:57.080
the naughty children from missing
out on the core curriculum.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.000
Core curriculum is important. That's
important. That's a very good angle.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.560
And it would be I think a
really welcome breathing space

11:04.560 --> 11:07.080
for some of the single parents
like me. Yeah.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.520
Excellent.
We'll have to have a name for it,

11:09.520 --> 11:13.200
I thought you could call it Play
For Tomorrow. Play For Tomorrow?

11:13.200 --> 11:14.520
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
Thank you so much for coming in,

11:16.520 --> 11:18.880
and good luck with
the single mother thing.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.560
Yeah, I'll see you in a bit, Glenn.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.000
And you're against it?

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
It'll die on its arse, my grandma
was mugged by some ferret-faced

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
teenager with a neck tattoo,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.040
what are you going to do about it,
teach him the bassoon?

11:33.040 --> 11:36.480
It is as my mother would have said,
"Double wank and shit shifts."

11:36.480 --> 11:38.480
But do you think it's got legs, Hugh?

11:38.480 --> 11:41.280
Several. How did it play
with the focus groups?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.480
She loves it. Sorry?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.640
They love it,
they absolutely love it.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.480
You've got 94% approve/strongly
approve rating - that's enormous.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.240
Why did you say "she"?
I don't know, they call boats she.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.680
94%, it's all there,
black and white.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.400
It's difficult to argue, whatever
your foul-mouthed mother said.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.240
Yes, I can feel a stiffy in the post.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.320
Well, my guts still say no.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.120
As substantial as they are,
they've been outvoted.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.320
I'll talk to Tom about
green-lighting this.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.400
So that's a go, Terri?

12:10.400 --> 12:14.600
Just put the smell out,
see if anybody gags on it.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.960
Just float it.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.160
OK... Problem?

12:19.160 --> 12:24.760
Can we please try and stop
making policy on the hoof?

12:24.760 --> 12:28.760
We've been on the hoof
and we have been too hoofy. Have we?

12:28.760 --> 12:32.440
Well, if there could just
be some sitting down involved. Yeah.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.760
Just...you know,

12:34.760 --> 12:37.400
sitting down, that's all I'm saying.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.560
Yes, got the chairs we should,
we should probably use them.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.000
I think so. OK. That was it.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.360
Is that it? That's the problem,
no more, that was the only thing.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.440
Good point, thanks for bringing
it up. I'll go and float.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.760
OK. Face up?

12:49.760 --> 12:53.360
If you like, yep. See you, Terri.

12:53.360 --> 12:57.280
Erm, Malcolm, I know you were very
keen on Terri's appointment but...

12:57.280 --> 12:59.160
She's shit. I wouldn't go that far.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.960
She's a box-ticker Hugh,
she can't think outside the box.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.840
No in fact she's built a box
inside the actual box,

13:05.840 --> 13:08.480
and she's doing her thinking
inside that box.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.960
Exactly, I like that.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.360
Sorry I'm so tired, Malcolm, so much
stuff to read and think about at it.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.080
You seem to get through it
all right, don't you?

13:17.080 --> 13:21.320
Yeah well I find the time,
you know, somewhere.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.720
Do you get lonely? No.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.320
No, neither do I.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.520
So, did you watch the Zeitgeist tape?

13:29.520 --> 13:31.040
Yeah, some of it, yeah.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.080
So you know EastEnders?
You know Little Mo from big Mo?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.120
Boom-boom-boom-boop.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.840
What? I haven't watched it, no.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.920
What the fuck
are you playing at, Hugh?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.840
Are you playing at being
a Minister,

13:41.840 --> 13:44.480
or are you actually
a real life fucking Minister?

13:44.480 --> 13:46.080
I'm a real life Minister.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.880
I've never seen headlines like it.
In what way? It's all gone to shite.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.600
Oh, the papers didn't
like the policy?

13:52.600 --> 13:55.680
They fucking loathe it.
Are you getting all this, Hugh?

13:55.680 --> 13:58.040
Yes, you're very clear.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.560
Do they all hate it? The Times?
Especially The Times.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.000
'Wait a second, the first editions
haven't even gone to bed yet,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.120
'how do you know...'

14:06.120 --> 14:07.440
Because I'm connected,

14:07.440 --> 14:10.440
I'm plugged into the matrix,
I am the fucking matrix.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.960
Sorry?

14:11.960 --> 14:13.920
Have you not watched that tape yet?

14:13.920 --> 14:16.640
'I'm taking it home now and I'm
gonna watch it there.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.640
'We've just bought
a new video player

14:18.640 --> 14:21.240
'off the back
of Alicia's obsession with Pingu.'

14:21.240 --> 14:24.200
I want you all to pay attention.
'I've heard of Pingu.'

14:24.200 --> 14:27.000
This arts policy is dead, OK?
As of now.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.600
Get a press release in the oven,
fuck off the lot of you.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.320
And Hugh, watch that tape...

14:33.320 --> 14:36.960
'Sorry I was in the Blackwall
Tunnel, could you repeat all that?'

14:36.960 --> 14:40.160
Anyway these focus groups,
they're absolutely useless.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.160
Oh, it's useless to ask people what
they think is it,

14:43.160 --> 14:45.640
it's useless to ask people
their opinions?

14:45.640 --> 14:47.520
There's no point in asking people,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.120
they don't know what they think

14:49.120 --> 14:52.600
or they think that you should bring
back hanging for traffic wardens

14:52.600 --> 14:56.800
or they think what every
right-minded person would

14:52.600 --> 14:56.800
and that's just common sense.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.400
Oh, yeah, I'm Jeff average,
I think like everybody else.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.400
I'm Mr-Average-normal-bloke

15:01.400 --> 15:03.960
and everybody thinks like me because
I work in IT

15:03.960 --> 15:05.840
and on the weekends
I pop a few pills

15:05.840 --> 15:07.040
and I do a bit of DJing -

15:07.040 --> 15:09.000
spare cash because
I'm a single mum

15:09.000 --> 15:11.160
and I'm a member of the
National Trust,

15:11.160 --> 15:13.960
I enjoy any sports on TV,
anything with Colin Firth,

15:13.960 --> 15:17.160
I enjoy domestic violence
and sun dried fucking Karaoke.

15:17.160 --> 15:21.200
Not everybody is the same, Glenn,
people can surprise you!

15:22.720 --> 15:24.720
Was that good natured joshing?

15:24.720 --> 15:28.600
PHONE RINGS

15:28.600 --> 15:32.080
Tucker.
Malcolm, hope I didn't wake you up.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.680
Hewitt...

15:33.680 --> 15:37.600
Yeah, I'm doing a piece this Sunday,
a big piece on focus groups,

15:37.600 --> 15:41.840
it's sort of inspired
by your latest policy disaster.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.680
'I'm going to be concentrating

15:43.680 --> 15:46.160
'on how your man Abbot
can't do a single thing

15:46.160 --> 15:47.520
'without focus groups.'

15:47.520 --> 15:49.120
I'm shaking with fear.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.640
That's sexual jealousy.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.680
'You are so very very witty,'

15:52.680 --> 15:55.040
pity none of it makes
it into your columns.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.640
I'd love to spend the
evening listening to you,

15:57.640 --> 15:59.480
but I've got better things to do.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.640
Fuck off

15:59.480 --> 16:03.640
back to your match reports, you twat.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.320
Hello. Hugh, it's Terri.
Yeah, hello.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.960
I'm sorry I've woken you up.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.320
I wasn't asleep,
I have to be picked up again soon,

16:14.320 --> 16:17.120
so I didn't think it was worth
taking my trousers off.

16:17.120 --> 16:22.680
Listen, I've just heard that Simon
Hewitt is doing another piece on you

16:22.680 --> 16:25.440
about how you rely on focus groups.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.680
'Oh, cock.' But I'll be straight

16:25.440 --> 16:28.680
onto it in the morning,

16:28.680 --> 16:32.000
so don't lose any sleep over it.
'Are you taking the piss?'

16:32.000 --> 16:36.040
Erm, no... I'm sorry I've got to go,
I'm sorry I've got an egg on.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.360
Right, see you in the morning.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.560
Yes, snuggle up, bye-bye.
Night, Hugh.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.000
Bitch!

16:43.760 --> 16:46.240
How fucked am I?

16:46.240 --> 16:49.640
Well, you look awful,
you quite often look bad...

16:49.640 --> 16:53.640
In terms of negative publicity,
on the fuckometer, where am I?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.400
Oh, twelve.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.960
Yeah, twelve say. Out of what?

16:57.960 --> 17:01.080
Erm, fifty.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.720
Oh, mine was out of ten.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.119
Right, so I'm
24% fucked according to you

17:06.119 --> 17:09.240
but according to you
I'm 120% fucked.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.720
Erm, yeah.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.720
Terri, have you got anything for us?

17:12.720 --> 17:16.280
I can't ask them to drop the piece,
it would make us look pathetic.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.880
I don't mean to come across
all Mr Grab Grind

17:18.880 --> 17:22.079
but sorting out the press
is what you do for a living.

17:22.079 --> 17:25.520
This is Malcolm's problem, anyway.
It was him that spun that...

17:25.520 --> 17:27.599
Listen up,
this is what we're gonna do.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.680
I'm bringing forward Hugh's interview
with Angela Heaney to this afternoon.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.120
Morning, Malcolm. It goes out
as a spoiler tomorrow morning,

17:34.120 --> 17:36.600
that way we can get our side
of the story across

17:36.600 --> 17:41.240
and also piss all over
Simon Hewitt's cornflakes,
sadly only metaphorically.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.680
Right OK, Olly, call Heaney,
Terri, get on to our editor,

17:44.680 --> 17:48.040
Glenn, book a room,
Bodie, Doyle, you go round the back.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.240
At times of stress, I make jokes.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.160
Right, erm, what do I do?

17:55.160 --> 17:59.960
Sit down in front of the TV,
you're gonna watch
that Zeitgeist tape now. Right.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.680
THEME TUNE FROM THE BILL

18:07.320 --> 18:11.720
Shit. Yeah, I know but people
watch it, this gets six million.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.480
Oh, shit.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.280
What?

18:16.280 --> 18:18.000
She's an actress.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Who?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.040
Mary from focus group,
she's an actress.

18:23.040 --> 18:27.240
Oh, relax that doesn't matter, these
focus groups they do it all the time.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.360
They bung in a couple of actors.

18:29.360 --> 18:34.440
It doesn't matter because it's
a focus GROUP, key word, GROUP.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.280
Oh, I just remembered, erm,

18:38.280 --> 18:41.400
can you just...? Shall I pause it?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.680
If you could pause it,
for a second I'll be...

18:43.680 --> 18:45.880
I'm sorry I'll just be back
in a sec.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.840
Glenn, I've got a bit of a problem.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.800
What? You remember Mary
from the focus group?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.960
What Miss Immaculate
Bloody Conception?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.640
She's an actress.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.960
What do you mean?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.040
What I mean...

19:02.040 --> 19:05.520
there's no clearer way of saying
it, she's an actress. Are you sure?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.360
She's in The fucking Bill.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
Oh, Jesus!

19:09.360 --> 19:12.480
This doesn't necessarily have
to be a total fucking disaster.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.840
It means she wasn't for real.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.360
She's not really a stay-at-home
middle-England housewife

19:18.360 --> 19:22.120
she's just playing a part,
so what she said wasn't, you know...

19:22.120 --> 19:23.720
Yes, I do know.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.720
What who said what, wasn't what?

19:25.720 --> 19:30.680
Focus groups listen
to the opinions of ordinary people,
except they're not ordinary people,

19:30.680 --> 19:34.440
they're fucking actors so they're
not technically people at all.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.520
Can I get back to you?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.800
Your fucking legend
is a fucking actress.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.200
The focus group companies
do it all the time,

19:41.200 --> 19:46.080
if they can't copy together
the right cross section
they call a casting agency.

19:46.080 --> 19:50.640
Hire an opinionist, it's
only three Liberals, two fucking
Mavericks and a racist!

19:50.640 --> 19:56.040
We've based the whole thing
on her, just
her, her alone don't you see that.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.760
Why didn't you run it past me
for once? Oh, shit, shit!

19:59.760 --> 20:02.240
THEY WHISPER:

19:59.760 --> 20:02.240
No, you didn't. It's not real.

20:02.240 --> 20:07.400
I thought I recognised her.
You know, she was in
Midsomer Murders.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.560
Why didn't you say anything?
I saw her in Midsomer Murders...

20:10.560 --> 20:15.600
I thought she might
have a twin or something.
What a stupid thing to think!

20:15.600 --> 20:17.640
WHISPERING CONTINUES

20:20.800 --> 20:22.320
Fuck, fuck!

20:22.320 --> 20:25.040
CRASH!

20:25.040 --> 20:27.120
You said she...

20:27.120 --> 20:31.200
Yes...

20:27.120 --> 20:31.200
Come out of the cupboard, Hugh. No.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.480
Hugh, we have to sort this out.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.760
When I asked you about
the focus group... Yeah.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.000
You said she loved it.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.200
We gave her a one-on-one.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.720
Why?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.880
She's middle England.

20:57.560 --> 21:03.440
So "middle England" is a big fucking
field with one woman standing in it.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.600
Do you think Hewitt will find out?

21:05.600 --> 21:08.320
Of course he fucking will,
she's his mole.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.400
That's why he's got a piece
in the paper tomorrow.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.920
We've got to shut this
down now, right?

21:13.920 --> 21:18.760
I want this leaked to Angela Heaney,
it's damage control, OK?

21:18.760 --> 21:24.720
We put out the story the way we want
it, before Hewitt fucks us up
the bugle, get onto it now.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.000
It was Olly's... I'm sorry but it
was Olly's idea, I went with it.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.160
It's not my fault. The agency lied
to us, Hugh, the agency lied to me,

21:29.000 --> 21:34.160
it's not my responsibility...

21:34.160 --> 21:36.920
It's my fault for going with it,

21:34.160 --> 21:36.920
we should get her in.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.360
Get onto Heaney and her editor.
I'm onto it, Malcolm.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.480
Talk to Angela, right,
set her up get her to do this.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.680
Can I speak to Angela Heaney,
please?

21:44.680 --> 21:48.120
Malcolm, I think we've made
the wrong decision...

21:48.120 --> 21:51.920
Look, I didn't know that
she's an actress. No, exactly.

21:51.920 --> 21:56.320
We've been lied to, we've been
abused, we are the victims of abuse.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.840
Can you call her?
Shut up. Yes, I'll call her.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.040
How could I have known?
You are a broken vase.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.960
What the fuck? You're a broken vase.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.520
How do I know she's an actress?

22:04.520 --> 22:08.080
I never watch television. That's why
you have to give me a stupid tape.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.520
We're gonna get her in,
we're gonna talk to her...

22:10.520 --> 22:13.880
She'll meet us, I will talk
to her. I'm good with people.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.840
She can help us, she'll see
our point of view, we'll be fine.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.280
Well, I hope so, I hope
that's what's going to happen.

22:20.280 --> 22:23.160
Or we kill her.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.280
Can you try and make
him look presentable?

22:25.280 --> 22:28.920
What is he looking dirty?
Comb his hair, change his tie.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.320
It's fine, don't worry about it.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.240
You're looking evening television,
I want you to look afternoon.

22:35.240 --> 22:40.080
You want me to wear a fucking
Hawaiian shirt? I'll see
if we can find one(!)

22:40.080 --> 22:45.600
No, she can't have a car.
Don't fucking mother me, OK?

22:45.600 --> 22:49.560
I'm not so much mothering,
just, just wanting to help.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.640
Are we getting her, Mary in,
can we get her in...tonight?

22:52.640 --> 22:54.200
Yes. Won't that look a bit odd?

22:54.200 --> 22:59.680
Anyone have a number?
I've got a number for the agency...
Get onto the agency.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.520
It's all right.

23:10.600 --> 23:14.800
Mary, you know Hugh,
you've met Glenn before... Yeah...

23:14.800 --> 23:18.040
This is Malcolm Tucker,
he's our Director of Communications.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.840
Take a seat, Mary.

23:19.840 --> 23:25.600
So, listen, we are so grateful for
you coming in at this ungodly hour.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.600
Is there a problem?
Yeah, there's a problem,
you flapping your trap.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.080
The issue is,
the issue of you being an actress.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.960
Right, I actually prefer actor.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.960
I'm sorry, sexist, I'm sorry.
Yeah, absolutely.

23:39.960 --> 23:46.200
Essentially, you know,
what you told us you know
that was fundamentally honest,

23:46.200 --> 23:47.560
it was the truth,

23:47.560 --> 23:51.400
They were genuinely
your thoughts, weren't they?

23:51.400 --> 23:55.320
I haven't got two children but apart
from that it was essentially...

23:55.320 --> 23:58.080
Most of this is really
to protect you...

23:58.080 --> 23:59.800
You invented the kids? I was...

23:59.800 --> 24:02.240
You made up small children?

24:02.240 --> 24:03.880
I know small children. That's sick.

24:03.880 --> 24:08.760
But I know small children,
I was just being representative.
Jesus Christ, I'd...

24:08.760 --> 24:12.720
You invented children. I was giving
you what you wanted.

24:12.720 --> 24:17.880
Eventually you lose track
of what you're saying and the lies
compound themselves

24:17.880 --> 24:22.680
and you end up all over the place
like a crazy woman's shit
and that's OUR problem.

24:22.680 --> 24:26.040
What we've done is we've given
the story to a tame journalist,

24:26.040 --> 24:30.480
one who's more,
you know, likely to be sympathetic.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.760
Think about what is going
to happen tomorrow.

24:32.760 --> 24:36.600
Because tomorrow you are going
to find the press all over you...

24:36.600 --> 24:39.320
In a good way?
No, not a good way at all.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.360
That film Notting Hill,
have you seen that?
She's probably fucking in it.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.480
You know that bit where
the guy opens the door

24:44.480 --> 24:49.840
and there's like millions of
journalists and flash bulbs

24:44.480 --> 24:49.840
are going off.

24:49.840 --> 24:54.120
That's going to be you, darling,
they'll be all over you
like fucking cockroaches.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.440
It's OK, it's OK...

24:57.440 --> 25:00.760
No, it's not OK, it's not
going to be OK

25:00.760 --> 25:05.040
and I'll tell you why
because you're fair game

25:05.040 --> 25:08.240
so I hope your knickers are clean
because every sniffing shit-bag

25:08.240 --> 25:12.120
that's ever filed a by-line
is going to be questioning you,

25:12.120 --> 25:15.760
cos now it's in the fucking
public interest, isn't it?

25:15.760 --> 25:18.880
And they're gonna hit you
with any shit they can find

25:18.880 --> 25:23.320
and you're going to be there in front
of them like a trollop in the stocks.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.680
I still don't really
understand what's going on.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.680
We can hold those dogs back,
right...? Right.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.760
What do you mean? We can get
you a nice journalist, yeah?

25:32.760 --> 25:36.400
Yes. We can get you a nice young

25:32.760 --> 25:36.400
journalist,

25:36.400 --> 25:38.840
Angela Heaney and maybe you...

25:38.840 --> 25:41.600
I mean I don't know what shit
that he made you sign

25:41.600 --> 25:43.880
but whatever it was it was bullshit.

25:43.880 --> 25:47.200
Maybe if you just say
that you were misquoted

25:47.200 --> 25:51.760
and also that Simon Hewitt's a prick,
if you just said that. Who?

25:51.760 --> 25:54.280
The journalist that
you told your story to.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.680
I didn't,

25:54.280 --> 25:56.680
I didn't talk to any journalist.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.640
You spoke to Simon Hewitt... Simon?

25:59.640 --> 26:02.280
No I... You fucking spoke
to Simon Hewitt.

26:02.280 --> 26:06.120
He's a fat guy with a tiny little
dick, you fucking spoke to him.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.200
I really think I'd like to go now.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.520
Did you speak? I don't even know...

26:10.520 --> 26:15.000
You didn't speak to him.
She didn't fucking speak to him.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.800
I don't know anyone called Simon,
whatever the...

26:19.800 --> 26:22.280
Hewitt. Simon Hewitt. Hewitt, yeah.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.800
She doesn't even know, Malcolm.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.280
Fuck's sake.
What's the matter with him? Olly...

26:27.280 --> 26:30.040
Sorry for anything I said
that might have upset you.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.840
Sorry, there's just been a crossed
line, darling, sorry about that.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.480
Will you leave me alone?

26:36.480 --> 26:39.080
Jesus. For fuck's sake!

26:39.080 --> 26:42.320
She didn't even know. Fuck 'em.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.920
That didn't really work, did it?

26:45.920 --> 26:50.080
Can I just get this straight just
for my own, for my own sanity...?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.760
If we get on the phone,
can we pull the front page?

26:52.760 --> 26:54.600
No...it's too late.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.160
Heaney's piece is going
to go ahead anyway now?

26:57.160 --> 26:59.400
Of course it's going
to fucking go ahead,

26:59.400 --> 27:02.480
I mean I'm good but I can't
fucking hold back the tide!

27:02.480 --> 27:06.400
That's it. I'm going to bed.
Kind of ironic really...

27:06.400 --> 27:09.480
You're fucking on your own!

27:09.480 --> 27:12.320
She hasn't actually
spoken to Hewitt

27:12.320 --> 27:19.040
and we've voluntarily released
the story to the...

27:19.040 --> 27:22.360
to the press...unnecessarily...

27:22.360 --> 27:26.120
Damn! And who's that evil Scottish
guy? He was awful.

27:26.120 --> 27:30.280
He's just the Director of
Communication, Malcolm Tucker.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.160
He was ordering me...

27:32.160 --> 27:35.160
He wasn't ordering you...
That's a big story in itself...

27:35.160 --> 27:38.280
dragging me out of bed
and then telling me what to say.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.040
Some papers might be
interested in that.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.800
This department's got
a lot of initiatives coming up...

27:42.800 --> 27:44.960
Has it really, has it really?

27:44.960 --> 27:49.040
And we're going to need
fairly like, you know, the
face for the renewal for...

27:49.040 --> 27:51.760
soon we're gonna
have a whole campaign,

27:51.760 --> 27:53.480
new stationery, pens...

27:53.480 --> 27:56.560
face won't probably fit on,
we've got all that...

27:56.560 --> 28:01.440
You are trying to bribe me
with a stationery photo shoot?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.120
No, erm...

28:03.120 --> 28:07.240
None of this is happening,
no, not bribe, no.

28:07.240 --> 28:11.680
That was just small talk.

28:07.240 --> 28:11.680
I was just chatting, small chat.

28:11.680 --> 28:15.480
Can you wake me
in a couple of hours?

28:15.480 --> 28:19.320
There's no time to go home,

28:15.480 --> 28:19.320
I'll pass myself coming back in.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.680
I'll ring Catherine
and say you won't be home.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.760
Hi, how did you get on...

28:28.960 --> 28:30.960
Happiness?

28:30.960 --> 28:33.120
Go away, Terri.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.080
I'll clear up a few biscuits
whilst I'm at it.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.480
Kate, erm, just leaving
a message for you,

28:41.480 --> 28:45.920
I know you're asleep by now
from Hugh, love to the kids,

28:45.920 --> 28:51.760
see Alicia in the morning
and big kiss
and sorry about the bedtime story,

28:51.760 --> 28:54.920
lots of love via Glenn,
nightie-night.
