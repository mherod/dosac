00:02.120 --> 00:05.440
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

00:05.440 --> 00:09.240
Basically get crisps shaped like

00:05.440 --> 00:09.240
rockets, rainbow coloured ice cream,

00:09.240 --> 00:11.680
the sort of stuff that
kids have at their parties.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.080
Blimey, more, what are we
doing, opening up a dolphinarium?

00:15.080 --> 00:17.000
Good, sorted,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.800
so, where were we? Healthy eating.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.920
Beneficial lifestyle choices.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.640
Get in! What?

00:23.640 --> 00:25.840
I've just landed Andy Murray.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.440
Yeah! That's brilliant.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.560
Andy Murray, Andy Murray,
the face of healthy choices.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.280
The tennis player.
No, the fucking pianist.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.960
Nicola Murray nets Andy Murray.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.560
Well, we've both
netted him together.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.440
Are you sure you want him. Murray?

00:40.440 --> 00:46.760
Doesn't it sound like nepotism?
Like, in the way that people think
Russ and Diane Abbott are related?

00:46.760 --> 00:50.160
And Bill Murray's her father.
OK, I'll level with you,
I don't like him.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.960
Who would you suggest then, Terri?

00:51.960 --> 00:55.480
Paula Radcliffe.
Pooey Paula. That's not healthy.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.400
Shitting in your own pants, that's
definitely not a healthy image.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.240
She could demonstrate how
to do the hop, shit and jump.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.840
That is very unfair.
It only happened once.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.240
Once is all you need.
Imagine if Bruce Forsyth, at

01:06.240 --> 01:11.720
the start of Strictly Come Dancing,
there we go, you'd never hear the

01:06.240 --> 01:11.720
end of that and quite rightly.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.920
Terri, can we move on from
your hatred of Andy Murray

01:14.920 --> 01:17.680
and can we start trailing
a major DoSAC initiative.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.960
Don't give any details at this
stage, just say, it's major, TBA.
TBA?

01:21.960 --> 01:28.920
To be announced. It's
really self-defeating if I have to
explain abbreviations to you, FFS.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.880
What's FFS? Oh, for fuck...

01:31.880 --> 01:36.479
Oh, we are going to need Malcolm
clearance, Ollie. Glenn,
can you get rid of all this water?

01:36.479 --> 01:38.960
It looks like something out of
fucking Doctor Who.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.200
Here they come, it's
the Flying Scot's curry.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.440
# Where's your Papa Dom? #

01:43.440 --> 01:46.920
You've got to try
this aubergine, it's cooked in ghee.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.120
I fucking love ghee, it's
fucking freebase and butter.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.240
Have some more wine, get quaffing.

01:51.240 --> 01:55.200
MOBILE RINGS

01:51.240 --> 01:55.200
Christ, here we go.
No, we don't do take away.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.840
See, if this is recorded spam,
I'm going to hunt you down
and burst your fucking lungs.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.640
Where actually are you, Malcolm?

02:00.640 --> 02:04.320
I'm on holiday.

02:00.640 --> 02:04.320
Where are you on holiday? Where?

02:04.320 --> 02:07.440
Right, OK, I'm in Thailand in a sex
bar. About to get an fucking facial.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.320
Right, quick summary,
Andy Murray, famous tennis player,
also lovely Scotch person,

02:12.320 --> 02:14.920
face of healthy lifestyle choices.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.640
Nicola Murray, slightly panicky

02:17.640 --> 02:23.079
minister lady, wondered if that's OK
with you? Yeah, yeah, Andy Murray,

02:17.640 --> 02:23.079
Andy Pandy, fucking Gandhi had a

02:23.079 --> 02:26.040
hand shandy, what ever, just
fuck off out of my life, OK?

02:26.040 --> 02:27.600
Okey-dokey.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.079
The man from Hell Monte, he say,
"Fucking aye."

02:31.079 --> 02:35.079
Sorry about that, everybody's
heard about the cooking, so...

02:35.079 --> 02:37.200
Malcolm, what's all this about?

02:37.200 --> 02:41.040
Well, I know these are hard
times for print journalists, yeah?

02:41.040 --> 02:44.800
I read that on the internet. One day
you're writing for the papers and
the next you're sleeping under them.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.560
Right, so this is like
Malcolm Tucker's soup kitchen.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.280
Well, it is kind of in a way.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.040
I just think you should have one, big
square meal before you end up fucking

02:53.040 --> 02:56.040
living off White Lightning and your
own faeces. Come on, get stuck in.

02:56.040 --> 03:01.200
I'll dish it up for you. What about

02:56.040 --> 03:01.200
bringing back Steve Fleming, kind
of makes you old news, doesn't it?

03:01.200 --> 03:03.000
Are you repositioning
yourself, Malcolm?

03:03.000 --> 03:07.960
This is about a guy
sharing his ghee, that's it. OK.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.480
So you're not currying favour, then?
SHE LAUGHS

03:12.480 --> 03:15.960
Sorry! Fuck you, get out of
my house, get out of my house.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.840
That was good, Geoffrey, for you.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.840
No wonder nobody's fucking buying
your paper.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.960
He's really on holiday?
Malcolm hasn't been on

03:19.840 --> 03:22.960
holiday for 10 years.

03:22.960 --> 03:27.360
Malcolm's got to keep moving or he's
dead. He's like a shark or Bob Dylan.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.520
Who's driving the bus?
Morning, morning, DoSAC.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.240
Bollocky bollocks.
It's the Ghost of Christmas Shit.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.320
There's your answer, Terri.
There's the man driving the bus.

03:37.320 --> 03:42.880
That's Reg bloody Varney, all stops
to electoral oblivion, ding-ding.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.760
Get into my office, come
on, it'll buy us a bit of time.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.320
I've never seen Steve Fleming
in the flesh. You're lucky.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.720
For a man who brought us back into
power, his not very imposing, is he?

03:48.320 --> 03:53.720
He looks like a Lego policeman.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.120
Look at him. Super Mario.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.680
Morning, campers! Hi!

03:58.680 --> 04:02.080
Steve Fleming! Hello...OK!

04:02.080 --> 04:05.600
Hello, Nicola!

04:05.600 --> 04:08.280
Hi! You look like
you've lost some weight.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.600
Do I? I don't think so, but...

04:10.600 --> 04:12.320
I think so, yes.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.640
Your face looks quite gaunt. Muscly.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.360
Does it now?

04:18.360 --> 04:21.240
I come bearing caffeinated gifts.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.960
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Thank you very much.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.520
I'm going to cut to the chase.
I need you to publish...

04:27.640 --> 04:31.040
..all the crime stats since 2004

04:31.040 --> 04:36.080
as an accompaniment to our
transparent government launch.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.280
From 2004 up to the last quarter.

04:39.280 --> 04:45.120
OK, we are just about to launch
healthy choices with...Andy Murray!

04:45.120 --> 04:48.320
Andy Murray, ace!

04:48.320 --> 04:51.640
Good joke.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.640
We'll make a minister of you yet.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.120
After that, we can try and get you
something for, say, end of the week.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.280
After, why after?
Why not right alongside?

04:58.280 --> 05:00.840
Or, here's a thought...

05:00.840 --> 05:02.400
before.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.320
Because we're under resourced and
it's not a priority.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.000
The PM thinks it is a priority.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.160
It CAN be done.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.720
Oh, I seem to have
reached the end of my argument!

05:15.720 --> 05:20.560
OK, well, look,
why don't we say Thursday lunchtime?

05:20.560 --> 05:23.000
You've got Fran's leaving.
I have got a lunch.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.680
Thursday afternoon.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.920
I don't give a
fuck about Fran's leaving lunch.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.120
I'm saying now, now, now,
now, now, now.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.640
HE INHALES DEEPLY

05:31.120 --> 05:35.640
OK, chillax,
we're on the case, Steve.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.440
Lovely. Thank you very much.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.440
OK, well it's a delight to see you.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.800
Oh, another one.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.400
Mind my gaunt face!

05:42.800 --> 05:46.400
THEY LAUGH

05:46.400 --> 05:48.200
Bye-bye. Bye, bye.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.960
What you call that? Obsessive
repulsive disorder, I would say.

05:51.960 --> 05:57.880
I'm going to ring Malcolm. Holiday
or not, I'm going to ring Malcolm

05:51.960 --> 05:57.880
about this. "Caffeinated gifts!"

05:57.880 --> 06:01.120
Malcolm never bought us
coffee, I like him.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.280
Yes, well, you like bath salts.
You're basically an idiot.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.960
So, everybody's for coffee, eh?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.960
Mmm-mmm.

06:06.960 --> 06:13.880
Sorry I can't do espressos but I've
made this so thick and black it will
be like fucking drinking plimsolls.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.920
This Steve Fleming thing's going to
end in tears, isn't it? You sacked

06:13.880 --> 06:17.920
him last time.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.920
All right.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.600
Right, OK. Off the record, right, OK?

06:22.600 --> 06:29.200
While Steve is a useful tool, and I
do emphasise the word useful here,
I'm still running the show, right?

06:29.200 --> 06:30.960
If you're still running the
show, why do you need to tell us?

06:30.960 --> 06:37.880
Geoffrey, all I'm saying is this,
it would be very much fucking
appreciated if you could emphasise

06:37.880 --> 06:42.560
the fact that I'm at the heart of
government because it's fucking true.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.520
I AM the heart. I am the ventricles

06:46.520 --> 06:52.520
and the fucking aorta. Malcolm, we
get it, you're still the star of the

06:46.520 --> 06:52.520
show. It's not for me to say.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.920
No, you're still the star of
the show, until they start
wheeling out the celebrities.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.920
What's next, Malcolm, Ant and Dec
as the new fucking litter tsars.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.680
That's when you know you are
20 points behind in the polls.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.320
Oh, well, thank you very much,
Mr fucking Prick Robinson.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.120
Nicola,
it's your nephew on the phone. What?

07:09.120 --> 07:10.920
Your nephew, Andy Murray.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.720
On the line, now?

07:12.720 --> 07:14.520
It's Andy Murray on the line.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.560
What line? Press 2.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.160
He's not there, Terri.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.000
Maybe it was three. God, it drives
me insane. Is he there now? Yes.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.240
Hang on. Really pisses me off,
the fucking phones in this whole...

07:27.240 --> 07:31.320
Andy, hello! It's Nicola Murray,
yes, what a delight to talk to you.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.320
'Hi, Malcolm.' Ollie. Andy Murray.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.600
Oh, good, we are literally
confirming him as we speak.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.280
Ditch him.
We can't go with celebrities, right.
It's just going to look bad. Why?

07:42.280 --> 07:46.200
'Were going to look
desperate, right?' Well, Steve
Fleming likes the idea.

07:46.200 --> 07:52.120
Never mind what Mummy says, just
do what Daddy says, right? Whilst

07:46.200 --> 07:52.120
you're on, there's another thing.

07:52.120 --> 07:58.360
Mummy has asked us to publish
the crime stats as part of the

07:52.120 --> 07:58.360
transparent government initiative.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.880
'Is that all right with Daddy?'
It's fine.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.600
Really, because
Nicola's got that baffled, panicky
look like a child on a ghost train.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.560
Give me second while I look up my
file of things I really
don't give a fuck about.

08:08.560 --> 08:13.520
And here we have under the letter N
we've got, nail-bombing golf clubs,

08:13.520 --> 08:20.080
there is the National Trust, there is

08:13.520 --> 08:20.080
Newcastle, Nicola Murray, yes.
She's still there.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.560
So fucking can Andy Murray and get
on with the fucking crime stats.

08:23.560 --> 08:27.640
I'll make sure Kate liaises with
my press whiz kid, Terri Coverley.

08:27.640 --> 08:33.480
She's a woman. But, listen, if
there's anything else we can do for
you, please don't hesitate to call.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.640
Dare I say it, we are here to serve,
if you'll excuse the pun!

08:36.640 --> 08:39.760
All right, Andy, take care, bye.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.600
Malcolm says we have to drop him.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.800
What?! Andy, he's not in, he is now
out, apparently, according
to Malcolm,

08:45.800 --> 08:47.880
sent to bed without
any barley water.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.040
But he's an fucking tennis player.
We're not asking
Shane MacGowan, why?

08:51.040 --> 08:55.240
It's nothing personal. He's just
said, bringing in celebrities,

08:51.040 --> 08:55.240
looks desperate.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.840
It's the sign of a dying government.
We are a dying government!

08:57.840 --> 09:02.520
Our hair's falling out and we are
coughing up blood and our kids
are asking us to change the will!

09:02.520 --> 09:07.280
He was quite clear about this.
He said kill it, kitten,
breeze-block, sack, canal.

09:07.280 --> 09:12.360
Oh, I can imagine being clear about
it. Right. We've got to get on to,

09:07.280 --> 09:12.360
you've got to get on to... Me?

09:12.360 --> 09:16.000
Andy Murray's people and find a
polite way of saying piss off, Andy,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.280
apparently you're too well known to
front our public awareness campaign.

09:19.280 --> 09:24.880
Right, good news is, I have done all
that pile and that's in the system.

09:19.280 --> 09:24.880
Excellent.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.600
Fuck me. What's the hell's this?
It appears to be a trolley
full of crime stats.

09:29.600 --> 09:34.560
Vandalism, bicycle theft, oh,
this is ridiculous!

09:34.560 --> 09:38.040
Well, that's given us an
unexpected head start, well done.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.480
I would kill you but I'd have to

09:38.040 --> 09:41.480
add you to the fucking figures.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.960
Think about what you are going
to say. OK, I've done that.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.840
What, already? Is that enough time.
Kate, hello, Terri Coverley.

09:48.840 --> 09:53.760
Yes. We are thrilled about
Andy being on board. Get on with it.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.200
No, I'm not actually saying...

09:56.200 --> 09:58.840
End the call.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.720
Steve Fleming's here.
Put the phone down.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.520
Ah...Nicola Murray!

10:03.520 --> 10:05.960
How are the crime stats coming along?

10:05.960 --> 10:09.520
It's not easy, Steve, as you can see
but Glenn and Ollie are on top
of it.

10:09.520 --> 10:14.600
"Other theft", what the fuck is
"other theft"? If you want to stay
late or

10:14.600 --> 10:19.200
pull an all-nighter, if you think it
would help. You want us to work all

10:14.600 --> 10:19.200
through the night on this?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.520
It would be very much appreciated
upstairs.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.960
Well, I'm an atheist.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.400
HE LAUGHS

10:23.960 --> 10:27.400
By the Prime Minister.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.360
I did get the joke, by the way.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.680
(Well done.)

10:33.680 --> 10:36.440
Good morning, good morning,
good morning. I'm back!

10:36.440 --> 10:38.560
I'm sorry I left my
sombrero at home, but here I am.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.880
What do you think of the tan? What do
you think about this shade? I call it
custard cancer. Thank you very much.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.880
Where did you go?
I went to Easter Island.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.960
I thought I'd spend my time there
re-chiselling all the statues
so they looked like Westlife.

10:49.960 --> 10:54.320
How about a coffee? Oh, I've sent
you a link to Andy Murray's website,

10:54.320 --> 10:58.120
there something you should see.
Andy Murray's website.

10:58.120 --> 11:03.520
Andy says, "Just agreed to
lead the government's healthy
choices campaign. Eat, live, be."

11:03.520 --> 11:07.360
Well, fuck a Pot Noodle.
Sam, prepare my horse.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.520
I ride...to DoSAC!

11:12.720 --> 11:15.440
Hello, Terri.
Morning, Nicola. Who am I, Terri?

11:15.440 --> 11:17.760
You're Nicola. Nicola Murray?

11:17.760 --> 11:21.160
Secretary of State for
Department of Affairs. That's right.

11:21.160 --> 11:26.640
I'm Secretary of State. So why has
a sports personality launched my

11:21.160 --> 11:26.640
policy on his fucking website?

11:26.640 --> 11:29.160
Ah, no, I know exactly why that is.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.880
You didn't make the
phone call, did you?

11:31.880 --> 11:35.720
Nicola, in other really bad
news, good morning, by the way.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.800
This is about the crime stats?
Some of the crime
stats that we published, as it turns

11:39.800 --> 11:42.400
out, were unverified and not ready
for being in the public domain.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.720
Marianne Swift at the Mail...
Oh, swine-faced Swift.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.520
That's the one. She noticed a drop
in the figures for aggravated

11:49.520 --> 11:52.680
burglary in the last quarter
whereas when she checked it out...

11:52.680 --> 11:54.240
There was no drop? Yeah.

11:54.240 --> 11:59.680
Right, so Swine-face Swift and her
piggy hack hog colleagues...

11:59.680 --> 12:02.640
Exactly. So we are getting a
lot of oinking on the phones.

12:02.640 --> 12:06.160
So basically, what that means is the
department, well,

12:06.160 --> 12:10.960
essentially the royal you, seem
to have massaged the crime figures.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.600
Great, thank you Steve
"fucking Nicola" Fleming.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.760
Yes, he is an fucking...

12:15.760 --> 12:18.960
ninny, isn't it?
Bring my dispatch boxes. OK.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.960
Malcolm! Oh, there he is, Bob

12:18.960 --> 12:22.960
Carolgees, how's the wee comedy dog?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.720
Welcome back, good holiday?

12:24.720 --> 12:27.360
I hear your kitchen's
lovely at this time of year.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.800
Well, actually, I went to Spain.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.560
Oh, nice.
I went to Malaga. It was lovely.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.760
I was golfing with Stephen Hawking.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.280
He lied about his handicap.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.640
Mind you, I never had to hire a golf
buggy, I just sat in his lap.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.800
Please, why do we
have to be like this?

12:40.800 --> 12:43.200
All this negative energy, come on!

12:43.200 --> 12:46.760
What? Well,

12:43.200 --> 12:46.760
we've got to work together so...

12:46.760 --> 12:48.920
Do you know what,

12:48.920 --> 12:52.200
that doesn't mean we have to like
each other, does it? No. Sorry.

12:52.200 --> 12:58.960
We both know we don't like each
other, everybody knows that we are
the Gallagher brothers of politics.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.520
How does that work? Does that mean
I am a semi-talented song writer and

12:58.960 --> 13:03.520
you're the fucking loutish prick.

13:03.520 --> 13:08.080
That's a lovely analogy.
You were the one who forced
me out of the sodding band.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.480
HE CHUCKLES

13:08.080 --> 13:11.480
Come on, let's have a chat.

13:12.480 --> 13:18.240
You were asked to leave
the fucking band and you

13:12.480 --> 13:18.240
wouldn't fucking go, would you?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.760
You had to hang on in there
like a limpet up a whale's arse.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.760
Why do you thrive so
much on being disliked?

13:25.760 --> 13:28.800
People hate me, good! Bring it on.
Do know what they think about you?

13:28.800 --> 13:32.840
I'm sure you're going to tell me.
I'll tell you exactly
what people say about you.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.840
All right, go on then. Fuck all.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.200
Oh, do they, fuck all? People
have no fucking opinion about you.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.880
You're like fucking Special K or
fucking the Moody Blues.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.120
That's you, white noise in the
background. Do you find that funny?

13:45.120 --> 13:48.360
No, I don't find anything you're
saying funny whatsoever and I'll

13:48.360 --> 13:51.880
tell you a home truth,
Malcolm Tucker.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.640
The people who are really hated in
this country,

13:54.640 --> 13:57.840
the people who are really hated are
us, this government.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.120
How about we stand together? Let's
both be team players, shall we?

14:02.120 --> 14:05.560
Were you the Einstein that OK'd this
fucking Andy Murray thing at DoSAC

14:05.560 --> 14:09.000
because I've got the Telegraph on
here and you've probably got the

14:05.560 --> 14:09.000
Times asking why the budget's been

14:09.000 --> 14:11.800
pre-announced on Twitter
by fucking Ryan Giggs.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.880
Shit!

14:12.880 --> 14:19.920
"The last quarter's crime

14:12.880 --> 14:19.920
stats which DoSAC have published
art unconfirmed projections."

14:19.920 --> 14:21.840
Shit! That's DoSAC for you.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.400
Come on, Malcolm, team players.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.960
Bring me sunshine.

14:24.960 --> 14:29.040
No, we are not manipulating the
figures, somebody quite
simply made a mistake.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.960
No, I couldn't possibly say who.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.000
Glen Cullen. Glen with one N.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.960
We have actually decided to go in
a different direction from Andy.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.240
Good holiday? Shut it, you

14:36.960 --> 14:40.240
fucking hairdresser. Got any photos?

14:40.240 --> 14:43.200
I'll get a photo of you in a minute
with your cock nailed to the desk.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.800
Hey, you want to see something
that's really worth photographing,
Steve Fleming at work, eh?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.880
That the real master of spin.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.400
He's Spinney fucking Hendrix.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.800
Nicola, you and your
department have screwed up.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.960
I'd like to agree with the
previous speaker only adding
the words "fucking royally."

14:57.960 --> 14:59.960
Oh, Jesus, are my
being gang-bollocked?

14:59.960 --> 15:01.960
Andy Murray's Henman
fisting us in the press.

15:01.960 --> 15:08.000
We could have that... With undue

15:01.960 --> 15:08.000
respect, Malcolm, the crimes stats
cock-up is a much bigger deal.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.920
This is such a great double act,
isn't it? Good cock, bad cock.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.000
I tell you what, why
don't you go first? I need a wazz.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.720
I like you, Nicola, I quite like you,
but, darling, I've got to ask you,

15:14.000 --> 15:19.720
what the bloody hell happened?

15:19.720 --> 15:24.520
Like you asked,
we published the crime figures from
2004 up to the last quarter.

15:24.520 --> 15:30.360
Yes, up to the last quarter, but not
up to and including the last quarter,

15:24.520 --> 15:30.360
you dozy mare.

15:30.360 --> 15:34.480
Up to, includes the thing
you're going up to, right?

15:34.480 --> 15:38.360
If you say count up to 20,
it means count up to and
include the number 20.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.920
The events leading up to
the Second World War do not
include the Second World War.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.440
We haven't got time for a
semantic argument about this.

15:44.440 --> 15:49.160
Listen, sweetheart...

15:44.440 --> 15:49.160
Do not fucking call me sweetheart.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.600
I think you'll find Steve was
addressing me, the tash is a bit of
a giveaway. I'll draft a statement.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.240
You fucking will not draft any
fucking statement. I've been
minding the shop.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.160
You were fucking
minding the shop and what happened?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.760
A bunch of fucking school kids
came in and fucking dropped

16:01.760 --> 16:04.240
their trousers and fucking
had a shit in aisle five.

16:04.240 --> 16:10.280
Well, thank you for giving
us a guided tour around the

16:04.240 --> 16:10.280
Freudian nightmare of your head.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.720
Could you two decide between you,
in which order and from which
direction I'm going to be shafted?

16:13.720 --> 16:17.760
Andy, let me talk you
through the decision.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.040
We do need to go in a
different direction.

16:20.040 --> 16:23.040
We need to go black.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.680
What? Sentiment, comedy?

16:25.680 --> 16:30.200
Would you like to speak
to Oliver Reeder?
He's the sort of mastermind...

16:30.200 --> 16:33.120
Don't tell him that.
Fucking...

16:34.680 --> 16:37.120
Hello... Hello, Mr Murray.

16:37.120 --> 16:41.240
I can assure you that you'd
remain my number-one choice...

16:41.240 --> 16:45.400
but I put it together and I don't
get to have the final say

16:45.400 --> 16:47.240
on anything really,

16:47.240 --> 16:53.880
in any section of my life at all,
or even in my personal life.
Stop digging.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.880
Stop digging. Shut the fuck up.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.640
Ignore him. Just come with
me, come into my office.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.640
Malcolm, Malcolm! Malcolm!

17:03.640 --> 17:06.400
Sorry about this, everybody.

17:09.359 --> 17:13.200
Goodbye, give my regards to the
rest of the fucking Village People.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.920
< Nicola, excuse me,
it's Andy Murray,

17:15.920 --> 17:18.240
he's insisting on talking to you.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.040
Talk to him. What?
Get him back on board.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.560
Fucking talk to him.
No. You cannot be serious!

17:23.560 --> 17:25.359
Is that an attempt at a joke?

17:25.359 --> 17:27.040
He told me to kill it,
I've killed it.

17:27.040 --> 17:32.120
Right now, some photos in the papers
of a very boring man with tight
white shorts is going to be a

17:32.120 --> 17:36.760
very pleasant distraction from
Steve's fucking crime stats
abortion.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.440
If we need a fucking celebrity,
can we try somebody else?

17:39.440 --> 17:42.040
Steve Redgrave. He's a boring fuck.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.920
Lewis Hamilton. Fucking boring.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.800
Boring fuck and
fucking drives a car.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.480
Chris Boardman.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.480
Fucking cyclist, are you fucking
mental? Everybody hates cyclists.

17:50.480 --> 17:55.160
Even fucking cyclists hate fucking
cyclists. Plus he's a boring fuck.

17:50.480 --> 17:55.160
< Paula Radcliffe.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.600
No, she shat in the street.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.600
And she's a boring fuck as well.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.920
How about we just launch the policy
without a celebrity?
Oh, great idea(!)

18:02.920 --> 18:07.120
"Hello there, hi, everyone, I,
Nicola Murray would
like to say to you

18:07.760 --> 18:11.320
"that even though you don't know me
from Adam, I think you should cut

18:07.760 --> 18:11.320
down on carbs."

18:11.320 --> 18:16.200
Lads, let's get this
crime stats cock-up sorted.

18:16.200 --> 18:21.640
What have you got both got so far?
We've been trying to think of a
replacement for Andy Murray. Yeah.

18:21.640 --> 18:26.400
Some of the women footballers,
Jessica Clarke or Sue Smith.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.280
Or Faye White.

18:28.280 --> 18:33.800
I cannot believe the
energy going into Andy Murray.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.200
HE LAUGHS

18:33.800 --> 18:37.200
I can't...!

18:38.920 --> 18:40.480
What's his problem?

18:41.480 --> 18:48.720
Just try it and wrap your gin-addled
brain around this. I did say I was

18:41.480 --> 18:48.720
at the heart of government,

18:48.720 --> 18:54.000
but when... Excuse me. Malcolm, I

18:48.720 --> 18:54.000
need to talk to you.
One second, please.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.640
Listen, when that... When that
incident occurred I was on holiday.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.720
Are you saying to me
that my wee caravan is a
complete fucking waste of time?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.920
And my stupid fucking
wing mirror extensions?

19:03.920 --> 19:07.400
The crime stats and Andy Murray,
it's a double fault.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.560
Listen, if you're not a
prostitute or a pizza guy, fuck off.

19:10.560 --> 19:15.600
Steve, could you eat or
fuck whatever is at the door on your
fucking way out, please?

19:15.600 --> 19:18.880
No, thanks. ..How
can I be held responsible?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.600
For what? I've created a
what among the government?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.320
I've created a vibe?

19:23.320 --> 19:27.120
Listen, son, the only fucking vibe
you have to worry about is the one

19:27.120 --> 19:30.840
that your wife hides in her
knicker draw. ..I'm on top of this.

19:30.840 --> 19:36.680
Fine, fine, I'm just saying I'll
gladly lend you a hand if you feel
the need to keep your head down.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.800
I don't need to keep my head down
because unlike yourself, I don't

19:36.680 --> 19:39.800
give blow jobs to truckers.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.480
KNOCK AT DOOR

19:39.800 --> 19:42.480
I said fuck off!

19:42.480 --> 19:45.720
Oh...! It's Lord Nicholson.

19:45.720 --> 19:50.280
What an enormous...pleasure this is.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.720
In fact, it's the Right Honourable,
the Lord Nicholson of Arnage.
Kissing of feet may commence.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.360
You've got all your stuff ready for
your official lording ceremony?

19:58.360 --> 20:01.880
Have you got your mink thong
and ermine colostomy bag?

20:01.880 --> 20:07.160
I have to hide that unfortunately,
can't wear it on the tube
or the bus but I would.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.200
It would be great larks,
but there we go.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.840
How about a coffee?

20:10.840 --> 20:14.960
Well, if there's coffee going,
I never say no to a nice cup
of coffee.

20:14.960 --> 20:20.520
Do you not drink coffee
any more or is it all port
and swans' blood these days?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.600
Swan's blood, that does sound nice.

20:22.600 --> 20:28.120
No, I'm just sort of passing through
because we need to start booting

20:22.600 --> 20:28.120
up this crime stats inquiry,

20:28.120 --> 20:32.760
which, is in effect, an
investigation into the facts...

20:32.760 --> 20:36.400
You don't have to talk
to me about that, do you? I was on
my holidays then.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.840
Didn't you get my postcard?

20:38.840 --> 20:43.880
I'll speak to whomsoever I need to
speak to, holiday or no holiday.

20:43.880 --> 20:48.680
Where did you learn to speak like
that? Is there a special school

20:43.880 --> 20:48.680
that's just you and Brian Sewell?

20:48.680 --> 20:51.680
I'm going to leave you
to it, frankly. So soon?

20:51.680 --> 20:53.680
I'm going to make tracks as well.

20:53.680 --> 20:59.600
The problem is that you're shifting
from the man people love to hate

20:59.600 --> 21:02.120
to the man people just hate.

21:02.120 --> 21:06.760
From Simon Cowell to Piers Morgan.
See you later and remember
my door is always open.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.480
I had no idea, no idea that it
was Malcolm who drafted Fleming's
resignation letter in 2003.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.240
I forgot your political memory only
goes back two issues of
The Economist.

21:22.240 --> 21:26.480
Hey, there's a reference
to you here, Cullen. Where?

21:26.480 --> 21:29.680
"Alleged to have assaulted an
elderly aide at a party conference."

21:29.680 --> 21:31.520
Elderly aide?

21:31.520 --> 21:34.040
Elderly aide. It makes me
sound like a fucking stair lift.

21:34.040 --> 21:39.400
Cheap flights are back. There's

21:34.040 --> 21:39.400
something here from Continental,

21:34.040 --> 21:39.400
"Go to New York..."

21:39.400 --> 21:42.200
Hey! Dora the Explorer.
Still here then, Malcolm?

21:42.200 --> 21:45.640
Time for a milky drink?
Come on, come on in, I want
to have a word with you.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.840
There you go. How was Cabinet? Was
it good? Is Tom looking after you?

21:50.840 --> 21:55.120
You're all over the newspapers
like a pissing puppy, Malcolm.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.080
I think you'll find that's
what we masters of the
dark arts call a blip.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.920
Tomorrow, that will all be old news.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.520
It'll be like the fucking War Of
The Roses or Aids, remember Aids?

22:02.520 --> 22:06.560
Listen, Nicola, did Julius
mention to you about his inquiry?

22:06.560 --> 22:09.560
Yeah. The inquiry into the whole
fucking crime stats cock-up? Yeah.

22:09.560 --> 22:14.680
You know the phone call that came
through to me from your office
about the whole idea? Yeah, yeah.

22:14.680 --> 22:18.480
It didn't happen, right?
You want me to cover your back?

22:18.480 --> 22:22.960
I want you to get the old inquiry
screen out and slap it on
factor 50, why not?

22:22.960 --> 22:26.360
I tell you what, this is what I'll
do, I'll get for you some very

22:26.360 --> 22:30.200
good press attention for your
fucking healthy choices nonsense.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.400
How about that? I'll get you some
big fucking healthy headlines.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.680
You're in no position
to give me anything.

22:35.680 --> 22:40.480
You can't even get a fucking bagel
cleaned up off your door.
Do you mind?

22:40.480 --> 22:43.680
Do you think I can't get
it up any more, is that it?

22:43.680 --> 22:46.520
You're looking at fucking Lazarus,
sweetheart,

22:46.520 --> 22:49.880
and not just plain Lazarus, I'm
fucking self-raising Lazarus, right?

22:49.880 --> 22:56.160
Yes, I'll tell Nicola to expect
your call healthy choices sometime
this afternoon. ..Well done, Malcolm.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.200
He's very impressive, isn't he?

22:58.200 --> 23:03.760
In the way that Chairman Mao was

22:58.200 --> 23:03.760
actually quite impressive. That's
the thing about the evil, isn't it?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.480
Their amazing work ethic.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.680
How are the hacks?
Ready to eat their own cocks.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.480
They're only journalists,

23:08.680 --> 23:12.480
not fucking Rangers' supporters.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.480
I know they aren't.

23:13.480 --> 23:18.680
I need 10 minutes, I need to Google
some jokes about Andy Murray.
Shall I go first? Warm them up.

23:18.680 --> 23:23.280
Tell them Olivier is on his way,
but in the meantime, here's an

23:18.680 --> 23:23.280
audience with Peter fucking Bowles.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.880
Tuesday meeting...

23:24.880 --> 23:27.040
There he is, Screaming Lord Crutch.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.680
I like the flunkies by the way,
that's a very nice touch.
A wee bit Graham Norton.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.080
Don't needle me, Malcolm,
not when people are under scrutiny.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.520
I'm under scrutiny? Yes. Nosferatu.

23:35.520 --> 23:39.320
That's really fucking scary.
I'm walking on, we're moving on.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.760
I'm Ian Botham, I'm walking on for
hospice care.

23:45.120 --> 23:50.400
How's it going with Lord...?
I've not been in yet, I've been
standing here for 20 minutes.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.400
So if this phone call does
come up...

23:53.400 --> 23:55.920
No, no, that's a bit...!

23:55.920 --> 23:57.840
Don't do that.
I made it quite clear...

23:57.840 --> 24:01.520
I saw... I thought Nicola was
choking. She wasn't,
she was laughing

24:01.520 --> 24:04.360
retrospectively at your
massive shiny head.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.880
What happened, did
you get heckled off?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.760
Was the line "Taxi for Tom Selleck?"

24:08.760 --> 24:12.040
Yeah. Can I have a quick word?
Just five minutes.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.720
So, Malcolm...

24:22.800 --> 24:26.200
What is it? What's your problem?
Have you fucking
coughed up your own twin?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.960
No, no, no, no...

24:34.960 --> 24:36.920
I need to talk to Tom.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.840
No, Tom isn't immediately
available to you. Fuck off.

24:39.840 --> 24:44.680
Malcolm, the Prime Minister
respects you enormously.

24:44.680 --> 24:51.960
Sam, get hold of Pat...
Actually, I'm going to need that.
That's an official Blackberry.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.880
KNOCK AT DOOR

24:51.960 --> 24:54.880
Fuck off!

24:54.880 --> 24:57.800
Your five minutes starts now.
Fuck off.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.800
This is an acutely
private moment, Julius.

25:00.800 --> 25:06.400
Would it seem terribly rude if I
asked you to shit off for
five minutes? Yes, it would it.

25:06.400 --> 25:10.600
Julius... Can you fuck off as well!
Excuse me. Julius, what's the deal?

25:10.600 --> 25:15.600
At the moment,
Malcolm is getting the sack.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.280
Shit.

25:17.280 --> 25:21.400
Now? Literally, I mean...
I'm actually in the sacking.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.480
Let's see what the fucking Prime

25:21.400 --> 25:25.480
Minister has to say about that?

25:25.480 --> 25:28.000
Listen to me a minute,
the Prime Minister...

25:28.000 --> 25:32.760
supports you fully in whatever you
decide to do next.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.960
You, fucking Nicola,
tell them, fucking tell them
there was no fucking phone call.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.400
Speak, I fucking ask you, speak!

25:42.400 --> 25:44.600
Open sesame!

25:44.600 --> 25:47.640
I'm not here, Malcolm.
You are fucking here.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.720
Open your fucking mouth
for once and say something.
I'm not getting involved.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.360
You fucking speak, you've
always something to say.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.960
I'm only a Cabinet Minister.
Fuck off then!
Don't fucking touch me.

25:57.960 --> 26:03.080
Come on, Malcolm. You cannot
fuck me, I am unfuckable.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.360
I have never been fucked.
And if you fucking try and fuck me,

26:06.360 --> 26:09.280
you'll find my fucking arse
will grow fucking fangs.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.240
And fucking snap your cock off.
Will you listen to me?

26:12.240 --> 26:14.720
Tucker, will you listen?!

26:12.240 --> 26:14.720
Let's hear it.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.680
Listen to me for one second.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.840
Go right ahead.

26:18.840 --> 26:25.640
I wouldn't tell you what
I've just told you before

26:18.840 --> 26:25.640
I told the press pack, would I?

26:25.640 --> 26:28.280
That would be
very, very unprofessional.

26:28.280 --> 26:32.040
So there's no point in getting angry,
because the show is over.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.040
It's curtains. No curtain-call.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.920
Everyone loved the show,

26:38.920 --> 26:45.760
but it just wasn't buttering any
parsnips any more, brother.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.640
You don't have the fucking balls
apart from that fucking inflated

26:48.640 --> 26:52.560
fucking boil on the fucking
end of your fucking neck...

26:52.560 --> 26:55.760
Oh, look. Oh...

26:58.440 --> 27:01.040
(Malcolm Tucker resigns.)

27:01.040 --> 27:05.920
Looks pretty factual to me.
Fuck this. Fuck this.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.760
Kate, Kate...

27:08.760 --> 27:11.720
It's Andy Murray's agent.
Get her to piss off.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.720
Hi... No, absolutely not.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.880
Malcolm's gone! I'll call you back.

27:17.880 --> 27:22.880
What did you say? "Malcolm Tucker

27:17.880 --> 27:22.880
has resigned." Malcolm's resigned.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.920
What? Tape the telly...
Tucker's gone! He's resigned.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.120
Happy days.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.600
I just want to hug someone.
Is this good? It feels good.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.880
Are we sure it's good? Not because
I don't want to hug you, Terri.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.400
I'm not fucking finished.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.640
You are finished though,
that's what I've been trying...

27:42.640 --> 27:44.200
What are you doing to her?

27:44.200 --> 27:46.360
Don't worry.
Leave her fucking alone.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.400
Don't worry, it's all right.

27:48.400 --> 27:54.800
Wine! Got some wine from the
tackling drugs changes lives'

27:48.400 --> 27:54.800
launch. Where is it?

27:54.800 --> 27:57.160
Need a bit of help. What is it?

27:57.160 --> 28:01.560
Nicola, hi! He's gone. I know.
Would you like a glass of wine?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.440
No, thanks.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.560
Fantastic. I know, yeah.

28:04.560 --> 28:08.200
I've sorted everything out with
Andy's agent. More or less...

28:08.200 --> 28:13.440
I can't get it. This is no way to

28:08.200 --> 28:13.440
celebrate. Shall I hold it under a
hot tap? It's white wine.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.440
A cold tap then.

28:14.440 --> 28:19.400
What good is running it under
a cold tap going to do?
Don't do that, it looks awful.

28:19.400 --> 28:24.760
Get back to fucking
Wind In The Willows,

28:19.400 --> 28:24.760
cos that's where you fucking belong.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.440
I didn't ask you to come back in.
Would you leave my office, please?

28:28.440 --> 28:30.120
As for you...

28:30.120 --> 28:32.000
Malcolm, I'm sick to death...

28:32.000 --> 28:36.600
Don't touch me, Malcolm.
I will tell you this...

28:36.600 --> 28:40.560
You shafted me, boy.
I'll fucking strike you, Malcolm.

28:40.560 --> 28:45.160
I warn you. Don't touch that scarf,
that's Paul Smith. Twat!

28:45.160 --> 28:48.520
You'll see me again.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.720
You will fucking see me again.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.320
LOUD COMMOTION
