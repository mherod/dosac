00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.440
This programme contains strong language and adult humour from the start.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.960
Tickel's dead. What?

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.880
This is an emergency situation, You have to bash the Tickel button.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.640
You should all for an inquiry. Now.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.560
That's why I'm calling for an inquiry.

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.720
I need to have that email.

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.280
I'll do it.

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.480
I may have fleetingly supported the policy myself.

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.800
So you've essentially launched an investigation into yourself?

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.240
'I have decided to stand down as leader.'

11
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.960
Ding Dong! The useless bitch is dead.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.880
Oh, God. Here we go.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.320
Do you feel you've been stabbed in the back, Mrs Murray?

14
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.240
She won't be answering any questions.

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.200
Are you backing Dan Miller for Leader?

16
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.960
Thank you all very much.

17
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.520
There she goes, a tiebreaker in the making.

18
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.200
"Who was Nicola Murray? I'll have to hurry you, teams."

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.520
Farewell our shit and useless servant.

20
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.400
At least Miller's a step up from Murray.

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.560
He doesn't have Left and Right on his wellies.

22
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.880
I need your attention for thirty of your earth seconds.

23
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.120
This is what will happen. What is Stewart doing?

24
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.560
You will go to the Z drive.

25
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.920
You find a file entitled "Miller's Ascension, Whitehall Arab Spring".

26
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.840
Open, ingest, implement. And after that, I expect both of you.

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.280
You two, to get together.

28
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, fuck, the man made of space hopper is coming this way.

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.120
This is going to be about the inquiry.

30
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
I'm thinking I should resign now.

31
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.440
What?

32
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.320
You can't do that. You're Aslan, no-one shaves your mane.

33
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.960
I'm not a fucking lion, Phil.

34
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
There's going to be an inquiry into the death of a man

35
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.960
who died because of a policy I signed off on.

36
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.560
We all know how this is going to end.

37
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.640
I, I, I should take the dignified way out.

38
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
You've missed the dignified exit. That was straight away, basically.

39
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.720
Yeah.

40
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.760
The only silver lining in today's cloud of farts is that another one

41
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.960
of Morecambe and Wise's policy launches is ruined.

42
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.640
Are those the carers? They don't look old enough. Free travel passes or something.

43
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.760
It's another one of Adam and Fergus' 'Pop Up Book of Policies'.

44
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.600
Peter Mannion. Lovely to meet you. What vital work you do.

45
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.840
Peter, I'd love to introduce you to 'The Carers'...

46
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.400
I've just met them.

47
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.320
What's my plan? I didn't resign, and now this inquiry's

48
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.280
going to nail me up like fucking Barabbas.

49
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.080
Actually, he was the one they let go. Shouldn't have, he was a criminal. Wait.

50
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.040
We could wrong-foot Murray.

51
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.080
How? You could push for the inquiry to go wider.

52
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.200
Wider? That's mental! We want to shut it down.

53
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.520
Just hear me out.

54
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.320
We could look into the whole culture of PFI procurement.

55
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920
That is a good idea. Really? Fuck, that hurt to say.

56
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.600
But she's right, because Murray's husband's involved in PFI

57
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960
and he's as dodgy as a Russian... As a Russian.

58
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.880
We can backspin it, Peter. It's good.

59
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.680
But...but... Is revenge a mature response? Let me think. Yes, it is.

60
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.800
Right, let's poke her in the PFI's.

61
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.000
If you get any channel problems, just swing them past the purple Power Ranger over here.

62
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.720
Hello, again. Vital, vital work, so proud of you.

63
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.400
Terri, I've got a job for you.

64
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000
Ah, Peter. This is all pretty white-knuckle stuff, eh?

65
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880
Is it getting the old adrenalin pumping?

66
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.560
Assuming you can squeeze past the port and stilton? Shut the fuck up, you prancing shit.

67
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.040
Ah, we need to widen the inquiry into the Mr Tickel's death

68
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.640
to include the issue of PFI contracts.

69
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.760
Great. OK.

70
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.320
I'm just working on Fergus's Carer's Pass press release...

71
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.040
Good. Could you fuck that to one side for the moment and concentrate on this? Thank you.

72
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.120
Slip into neutral for a moment here, Peter.

73
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.560
We haven't got a green, so let's not hit the accelerator.

74
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.320
Here's another way of looking at it. Let's. Goodbye.

75
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.000
So, we heading home?

76
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.080
No, back to the office.

77
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.920
Oh. Really?

78
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520
Lots of people there have worked incredibly hard for me.

79
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.840
They're going to want to see me to say a proper goodbye.

80
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.040
Of course. Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

81
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.240
Oh, Christ, there's that fucking chop!

82
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.840
You've been chopped, Mrs Murray! How does it feel to be chopped?

83
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.640
You're a little bit late actually, Mr Chop.

84
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.960
You've... you've had your chips! Ha-ha!

85
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.400
That is precisely why I didn't let you go to the One Show.

86
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.240
Olly, for God's sake pick up. I've had it. I'm coming in from the cold.

87
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.280
I'm, I'm re-crossing the floor.

88
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.240
Oh, Glenn! These are the carers. This is Jack, and this is Rohinka.

89
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.440
Hello.

90
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.160
I'm really sorry for your loss.

91
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.760
Mannion's called for a PFI enquiry.

92
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.880
Oh, that's going to put the cat among the pussies.

93
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.560
We need to show that we were never in favour PFI and that we never

94
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.360
approved of the sell off of key-worker housing. However...

95
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.520
In a way that doesn't make us look like dicks for not saying so

96
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.160
at the time or shits for saying so now.

97
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.280
You know, we don't have much time. Well, let's just bin the Carer's Pass launch. Just bin it.

98
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.840
It's spring conference in two weeks. The Dungaree Jubilee.

99
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.560
That kind of stuff is exactly what the conference needs.

100
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.080
But we've been here for three years and we've done fuck all.

101
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.280
We haven't done fuck all.

102
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.840
No, no, seriously, think about it.

103
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.360
In that time, Apple have launched two iPhones,

104
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.640
three iPads and their boss is a fucking dead guy!

105
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.880
Yeah.

106
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.040
Let's just push it till the end of the day.

107
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.840
OK, we'll push it near the end of the day, but you know the... Robyn.

108
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.920
Hello, Robyn.

109
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.240
That, in fact, is my name.

110
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.520
Take a seat.

111
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.640
I know it's your name, because it was at the top of a redundancy list

112
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.080
that I've just looked at.

113
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.320
Right, stop rolling around naked in the headlines.

114
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.440
Blind Man's Crumpet's on the way up. If you're going to film her, try not to make it obvious.

115
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.240
And no smiling. Not even a wee fucking Anne Robinson, right?

116
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.360
The look we're going for should be solemn respect.

117
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.840
You know, like blokes modelling underpants.

118
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.800
Oh, hang on. Mannion's calling for a wider inquiry.

119
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.480
He's what?!

120
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.040
He's trying to drag you in - shift the focus to the PFI conflict

121
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.000
with your husband's company.

122
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.560
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

123
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.400
Fuck! What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

124
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.120
Go up there and smile for starters.

125
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.080
Yes, Dan! Dan, Dan can put the lid on this, can't he?

126
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.560
Course he can, because he is actually quite good.

127
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.680
I'm probably going to get quite emotional, might get quite teary

128
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.280
if I can find an onion or somebody to pluck my pubes.

129
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.320
Robert! Yes, sir?

130
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.080
I want you to get over to Fatty's. Yeah.

131
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.720
Make sure he's not hiding a leadership challenge from me.

132
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.320
Frisk him if necessary, all 300 of his folds. Get to it.

133
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.640
I will, do some small-talk, best wishes stuff,

134
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.320
and then I'll just casually bring up the inquiry.

135
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.880
Or, no! No, no, I should cut straight to the inquiry,

136
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.640
shouldn't I?

137
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.880
Oh, fuck, I don't know how to play this. Um...

138
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.000
This is why they got rid of me, isn't it? Isn't it?!

139
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120
No, no... This is it, this is it!

140
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.960
No, there were other reasons. Fuck! Come on, let's go.

141
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.520
Seat of the pants airways.

142
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.560
Are you smiling? I can't see your face. Make sure you're smiling.

143
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.800
Oh, here she comes. Yes, hello.

144
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.600
Ha, Thank you. Thanks very much.

145
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600
I hope you're not clapping because I've gone.

146
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.920
Ha-ha! Um, seriously, I, er, I feel over the past two years,

147
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.000
I've given it my best shot.

148
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.680
And I'm quite sure that my, er, successor,

149
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.480
whoever he or she may be, will achieve the victory

150
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.440
that this country badly needs.

151
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.520
I've got some, some very, er...

152
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.600
strong memories from working here, and I'll, um...

153
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.000
I'll keep those with me, for ever.

154
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.960
So thank you guys. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

155
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.320
Thank you. Thanks so much. Thanks for everything. Dan!

156
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.160
It feels a bit odd for me to add to your speech,

157
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.760
but I will be tweeting a tribute later.

158
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.960
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

159
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.320
I was just wondering if we could just have a private word

160
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.640
in my office, in your... Well, in, in, this office.

161
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.320
Umm, yep.

162
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.920
Yes? Great. Thank you.

163
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.080
Oh.

164
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.280
Oh! Ha-ha! Don't know where to sit!

165
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.240
I, er, actually I'll just grab... One of those.

166
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.560
This inquiry, you know, it's not really necessary now,

167
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.600
so if you want to say that, I'll just back down.

168
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.760
An inquiry wouldn't be a bad thing.

169
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.640
A clean break with the past in the minds of the electorate.

170
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.160
Well, I mean, the electorate, you know, like me.

171
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.880
Quite a lot of them voted me leader, so...

172
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.280
But you only beat me on a technicality.

173
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.640
Yeah.

174
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.160
I mean the thing is, Dan, you know, pragmatically,

175
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.640
I'm now a party grandee.

176
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.360
Malcolm, this is a private conversation.

177
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.040
You are not a grandee, you're a fucking blandee.

178
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.840
No-one knew what the fuck you stood for. Political fucking mist.

179
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.600
No substance, no weight.

180
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.440
You've got all the charm of a rotting teddy bear by a graveside.

181
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.640
By the way, women fucking hate you.

182
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.680
I can show you the polling.

183
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.400
They think you come across like a jittery mother at a wedding.

184
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.360
The best thing you ever did in your flat-lining non-leadership

185
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.800
was call for an inquiry.

186
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.800
Because that will fuck the government, and it will fuck you.

187
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.640
So now, please, just fuck off back to your home, you headless frump,

188
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.600
and prepare for your column in Grazia.

189
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.280
Steady on Malcolm, that's a bit strong. Come on, let's go.

190
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.040
OK, you... Well, you just need to know that you have absolutely

191
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.200
fucking done it now, Malcolm.

192
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.560
Because you're about to find out what it feels like

193
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.600
to have me pissing into your tent.

194
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.760
Well, you know what?

195
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.800
Your piss will never fucking make it into my tent, because by some

196
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.840
unforeseen Nicola Murray-shaped fiasco, like every fucking Nicola

197
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.360
Murray-shaped fiasco I've had to deal with for the last two years,

198
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.680
you'll end up blowing your own fucking stream

199
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.920
into your own fucking face. There's your golden handshake.

200
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.760
Finished?

201
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.280
You're finished.

202
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.800
We'll see.

203
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.360
Right. Well, thanks, Dan. Think about what I said.

204
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.800
Also might want to think about the fact there should be

205
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.880
an apostrophe in 'it's'. Illiterate fuckers.

206
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.160
What did Dan say about the inquiry?

207
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.920
Fucking Dan! He's just a... He's basically just a bent dummy

208
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.360
with Malcolm's hand shoved up his arse. Fucking..!

209
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.640
All right, just calm down. Bastards.

210
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.280
Do you want some Rescue Remedy? No.

211
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.040
Do you want me to send for some noodles?

212
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.760
No, I don't want fucking noodles!

213
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.000
I just...

214
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.320
Oh, God.

215
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.520
I just... I just want a fucking break.

216
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.800
Mmm.

217
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.800
I think we both need to think about where we're at.

218
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.960
You know, trajectory and so on.

219
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.080
Bollocks.

220
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.840
I don't want you.

221
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.480
I just didn't want everybody to go on the same day, that's all.

222
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.880
I'm fine. I've got me from here.

223
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.680
Box.

224
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.320
Box.

225
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.520
Fucking box.

226
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.160
Bingo! We just need to leak it.

227
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.480
You saying, "Key worker housing sell-off is possibly the worst idea

228
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.760
"since the invention of theatre."

229
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.120
Does that give us enough distance from Mannion?

230
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.120
Oh, yeah. This is your 'Get Out of Jail Free' card strapped to a fucking jet-pack.

231
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.720
We just need to leak it.

232
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.560
Well, obviously it can't look like it came from us.

233
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.960
Maybe it's time to bring Glenn back. He's been out on a limb since punk hasn't he?

234
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.280
Thousand year old Glenn Fiddich?

235
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.720
Yeah, fucking perfect. He'll love it. Olly, look, I'm feeling very exposed here.

236
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.920
I've got my cock out, it's covered in breadcrumbs

237
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.200
and the fucking pigeons are circling.

238
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.520
Look, please, just, just ring me back.

239
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.480
Mr Cullen, we would like you to leak...wow...this.

240
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.840
Don't worry. Nothing major, just an email that puts a bit of distance

241
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.720
between Fergus and the Tickel affair.

242
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.680
What? I go from being a turnip to a leak.

243
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.880
Still a fucking vegetable to you though, eh?

244
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.840
You want to bring Mannion down a peg or 12, don't you, Glenn?

245
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.360
Well, of course I do. The up-his-arse Kensington Butcher.

246
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.120
Well, this is the cyanide capsule we'd like you

247
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.960
to break into his afternoon brandy.

248
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.720
This is it, Glenn, you're off the bench

249
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.400
and back on the pitch to score the golden goal in extra time.

250
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.400
Come on, mate.

251
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.640
Pick it up.

252
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.800
Fuck it. Why not? I'll do it.

253
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.640
Good man. Thank you.

254
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.600
I don't need to shake your hand.

255
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.880
All right. Touchy but not feely. Go. I'll have a look.

256
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.160
You are a brilliant bullshitter.

257
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.080
Yeah, well. Two years doing press for npower, it never leaves you.

258
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.000
PHONE RINGS

259
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.080
Hello, Malcolm.

260
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.840
Are you telling me he's still in a fucking ba... Sorry, excuse me.

261
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.280
Hello, Charlie Bucket. Hang on a sec.

262
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.000
Tell him to get out of the fucking bar, or I will come along

263
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.440
and personally set fire to the whisky-soaked bastard.

264
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.160
Hey-hey! You're missing all the excitement. Yeah, no, no.

265
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.400
I've been following developments on Sky News,

266
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.000
where they have actually stitched Dan Miller's head

267
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.720
to Usain Bolt's body.

268
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.680
Yes, well, get in a cab and get over here right now.

269
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.400
What me? You want me over there?

270
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.200
Of course I want you here. You are now my right hand man.

271
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.920
Is this one of those jokes where I turn up and you go

272
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.280
"Ha-ha, my right hand, that's what I wipe my arse with"?

273
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.200
That's a risk you're going to have to take.

274
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.040
All right, well, as soon as I'm signed off by a consultant, I'll...

275
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.840
Oh, who cares about the opinion of some golf-obsessed prick in a bow tie?

276
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.240
Just scoop your guts up, put them in a fucking wheelbarrow and come over.

277
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.160
Love you too.

278
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.160
Robyn. Carer's Pass has timed out, yeah?

279
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.200
Bundle the Munchkins out of the building, get them in tomorrow.

280
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.080
Right. Can we get them something for their travel?

281
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.240
Well, thanks to the Carer's Pass they get free travel!

282
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.320
But it hasn't come in yet.

283
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.040
So no.

284
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.840
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

285
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.480
Umm, it looks like we're not going to launch the Carer's Pass today.

286
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.680
Um, but we were wondering, could you come back at the same time tomorrow?

287
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.080
I don't know. Erm...

288
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.360
Have you got anything on? I mean, you know,

289
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.720
apart from the full-time round-the-clock

290
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.360
medical care of your families?

291
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.280
Ah ha! It's his Ollyness!

292
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.720
Olly, whose initiation rite into our little cabal of shitty devils here,

293
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.960
will be to go over and visit Fatty,

294
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.800
and to present him with this as a means of getting him

295
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.720
to shelve his ludicrous leadership ambitions.

296
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.800
Show him this. Oh!

297
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.880
Jesus, Malcolm! You could have left it in the envelope.

298
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.240
OK, come on everybody! Let's get to it.

299
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.000
I want Dan to wake up to the news that any opposition is Brian Jones.

300
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.120
Meaning?

301
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.400
Dead in the water.

302
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.560
Oh, yeah, right.

303
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.800
Could you?

304
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.480
Glenn!

305
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.240
What are you doing at my computer?

306
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.320
I'm just doing Bradford & Bingley a favour.

307
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.440
I'm bringing down Mannion by leaking an email.

308
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.120
A leak! Coming from my computer? No. No. Get off. Get off.

309
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.760
Take that...whatever it is, out of the...whatever it is. Take it. Out.

310
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.040
No-one will think it's you. Nobody leaks from their own computer.

311
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.240
Look, you do this for me,

312
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.840
and I'll make sure that you get the full severance package.

313
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.200
No questions asked, with full pension.

314
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.000
And a lump sum.

315
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.240
Yeah. I guess. Yeah.

316
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.720
The thing is, Glenn, I've got my eye on a tea shop near Ludlow.

317
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.520
Without a lump sum, no tea shop. No can do.

318
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.120
OK, right. This can go straight to Geoffrey at The Guardian. Yeah?

319
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.160
OK.

320
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.640
Right. Can we do it together?

321
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.960
What?

322
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.560
Please. Just your hand on mine, my hand on yours. Just to it together. Like, um...

323
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.280
Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.

324
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.440
Yes, OK.

325
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.000
Not that I'm saying you're butch.

326
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.240
No, of course not.

327
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.240
One, two, three.

328
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.720
Just send the email.

329
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.840
Ah, Team Peter. Come on, guys.

330
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.880
Let's take a little imagination stroll

331
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.720
through a virtual enquiry, huh?

332
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.000
Oh, dear God, not another whiteboard session.

333
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.840
I've got a note from my mother, I have a verruca.

334
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.440
I just want to get an overview, Peter.

335
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.560
A helicopter shot of where we currently are.

336
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.240
Who's most to blame in the blame garden.

337
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.400
OK, the onion is PFI, let's peel back some layers.

338
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.880
Murray resignation. How do we feel about that? What's Tickel's M records?

339
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.680
Medical. It's his leaked medical records.

340
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.920
Leaked? I thought they were common knowledge.

341
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.360
Well, they are now. Because they have been leaked.

342
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.480
Did you know this? Number 10 knew, so I knew, yeah.

343
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.760
What about you?

344
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.960
Yeah, I thought Tickel leaked them himself.

345
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.600
Who would voluntarily leak their own medical records?

346
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.240
You'd have to be mad to do that.

347
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.840
He was mad. That's precisely what his records said.

348
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.160
Exactly. He was a male nurse. That's not just mad, that's mental.

349
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.520
Phil! Did the last 30 years only happen to other people?

350
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.800
Why didn't I know about this? Leaking medical records is illegal.

351
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.400
Now I look guilty and incompetent.

352
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.680
Ah! Peter, incompetent.

353
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.760
Look! Don't write that down! I'm not on your sodding onion!

354
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.120
What is GFU? Good for us. Mmm?

355
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.320
Oh, shit with a capital shit. We've got to go.

356
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.560
Great.

357
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.920
No, no, no. Sit.

358
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.880
The Guardian have received an e-mail from Fergus.

359
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.400
Actually, do you know, strike that. Chain of emails.

360
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.440
Oh, perfect. With all of our comments about Mr Tickel underneath.

361
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.040
Oh, God. Not the one where we all piled in with the Mr Men jokes?

362
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.480
Yes, that one, Phil.

363
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.000
Oh, you kid me. Jesus!

364
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.120
I kid you not!

365
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.080
Oh my giddy fuck.

366
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.920
They've leaked all the bloody emails.

367
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.880
"Mr Tickel sounds like a gropey clown at a kid's party".

368
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.400
I can't see! Can I make it bigger?

369
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.440
Go to settings. "Poor Ickle Mr Tickel, perhaps he's meant to be sickle".

370
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.640
That's from Fergus.

371
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.080
Is this settings?

372
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.600
Ah! I think I've just taken a picture of my feet.

373
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.760
PHONE RINGS

374
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.760
Yep?

375
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.040
What? Where?

376
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.400
Right. I don't know.

377
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.360
OK. Rugby tackle him, or, or taze him. Gaffer tape him to a seat.

378
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.760
He can't come up here.

379
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.960
Er...Glenn is in reception.

380
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.320
Hoddle? Miller? Close? Morangie?

381
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.200
Cullen. Glenn Cullen is in reception.

382
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.240
Glenn?

383
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.280
Yeah.

384
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.160
Why are you even fucking telling me that?

385
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.600
When the Queen's butler finds a cockroach in the pantry,

386
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.880
he just stamps on it.

387
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.120
Yes. She doesn't even know.

388
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.640
OK, OK. I'll go and stamp on the cockroach, Malcolm.

389
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.600
'..the whole enquiry into the whole culture of leaking...'

390
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.520
Sam, Sam! Get me Stewart Pearson on the phone!

391
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.280
Olly, shouldn't you be in bed?

392
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.760
Shouldn't you not be here?

393
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.760
Whoa, stop, stop, whoa! You can't go up there.

394
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.520
No, I have to. I can't go back over there.

395
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.080
It's like Alien versus Predator. I want back in! Here!

396
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.920
Everybody is tremendously appreciative of what you've done.

397
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.440
It was a noble sacrifice, but...

398
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.520
What do you mean, sacrifice? I thought we had a deal?

399
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.240
Sacrifice sounds very one sided.

400
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.480
Piss off sounds one sided, but there we go.

401
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.200
Hey, Malcolm.

402
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.120
Why is he still here? Can you not perform a simple task?

403
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.200
When there is a shit on your doorstep, you hose it off.

404
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.880
You don't try and talk it into leaving of its own volition.

405
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.640
I got rid of Nicola for you. You owe me.

406
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.160
I owe you? Your act of treachery wiped the slate clean.

407
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.400
Rudolf Hess's fucking senile older brother.

408
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.160
Look, I know you think I screwed up,

409
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
but I came here on my hands and knees, Malcolm.

410
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
You, my friend. You don't exist to me any more.

411
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.320
I can't even fucking hear you.

412
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.760
Do you want me to beg? Is that it?

413
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.560
Because I will.

414
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.080
Listen, Mary Queen of fucking Shits.

415
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.480
In the old days we would have just slit you up the middle

416
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.520
like a fucking Cornish pasty.

417
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.680
Hang your steaming entrails all around the Tower of fucking London.

418
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.320
Catch you later, you fucking traitor.

419
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.120
Sam, what is it? A call from Stewart Pearson.

420
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.760
Stewart Pearson. I'm the fucking wanker's lodestone today!

421
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.280
Stewart, yes. The goatee-bearded guru-boy of Company B.

422
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.800
It's a no, Glenn.

423
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.800
Yeah, Malcolm can this wait, Mmm?

424
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.520
Word is the PM's considering an inquiry into the culture of leaking.

425
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.440
No, no. Do you really think he's going to invite everyone into

426
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.320
our complex network of secret burrows?

427
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.240
Open up the whole of Watership Down?!

428
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.440
OK 'Bright Eyes'. I'm massively fucking reassured.

429
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.600
Look, you may as well have an inquiry into gravity.

430
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.800
Now, I have to go, Malcolm,

431
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.200
because I've got like a whole country to govern, yeah?

432
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.360
Could I use your pass to go to the loo again?

433
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.320
Thing is, if my swipe card is being monitored, then it's either

434
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.160
going to look quite like I'm skiving or have a bladder condition.

435
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.320
The primary thing I want to say first and foremost

436
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.080
is you can't blame me for this, Peter.

437
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.920
If anything, it's the culture of blame that's to blame for this.

438
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.320
Great to see you again. Such crucial work you do.

439
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.680
Meeting room!

440
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.360
Right. Sit down.

441
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.320
I can't resign. No.

442
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.680
And I'm not going to resign.

443
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.640
I had the perfect moment to, right early on,

444
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.480
when I could have resigned in a dignified and statesman-like way,

445
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.640
and you both advised me not to resign.

446
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.080
So now, I. Can't. Resign.

447
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.920
You shouldn't resign, Peter.

448
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.920
This is going to happen. One of you has got to go.

449
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.120
I want both of you to give me reasons why you shouldn't resign.

450
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.480
Erm, because, because, I'm a Special Advisor to...a...senior cabinet.

451
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.080
That's a job description, Philip. That's a job description.

452
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.240
That is not a reason.

453
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.760
That's just your job, from which I'm asking you why you shouldn't resign.

454
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.960
I...know...everything about you.

455
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.480
I am a, a world expert in, in, in Peter Mannion.

456
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.280
From, er...pin number to inside leg measurements.

457
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.760
I'm, I'm, I'm there, you know...

458
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.960
What's his inside leg measurements?

459
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.360
34. I've, I've given you everything, Peter.

460
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.160
You can't, I mean, I don't have anything else. That's the point.

461
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.720
I don't, I don't have any friends. I don't have any life.

462
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.440
I haven't had sex for five years, and I, I don't even enjoy it.

463
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.960
So, you know, I'm not going to get anyone pregnant.

464
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.160
I'm never going to get anyone pregnant, OK? I'm fucking seedless.

465
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.960
Where as she's just, just a fucking baby bomb! OK?

466
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.280
And she's going to go off all over the office and, and leave you!

467
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.640
I'm going to be here!

468
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.360
I'm sorry, but my good name is at stake here. Oh, Christ.

469
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.400
Peter, you must understand. I am an innocent woman. I'm the "DoSac One".

470
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.800
That's it. I've had enough. I've had enough of all of you.

471
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.640
You're all shit. I'm going to sort it out, by myself.

472
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.400
Did you hear that?

473
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.680
I can't bear that you think about me like this. Don't follow me. No, please!

474
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.720
Stop following me.

475
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.440
I insist, I insist. Peter, please.

476
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.280
All right, I admit it. I'm in love with you.

477
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.560
Now fuck off to your office and organise the wedding.

478
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.320
Mannion goes Mel Gibson.

479
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.680
Spot it.

480
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.200
You know what you've done? Yeah?

481
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.960
You bought a fan. You've plugged it in,

482
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.880
you've turned the dial up to maximum...

483
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.040
It wasn't a weak fan. Not one of those office fans.

484
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.920
It was a Dyson. And I stood the other side of it...

485
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.240
Did a liquid shit on it. Trousers down.

486
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.240
And where did the shit go? All over Mannion.

487
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.680
PHONE BEEPS

488
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.760
That's just priceless.

489
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.120
Fuck, hang on.

490
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.160
What?

491
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.760
Uh, check the fucking emails.

492
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.000
What are you talking about?

493
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.360
What the fuck did you give to Glenn?

494
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.440
Just the email...

495
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.320
But it's the whole... We're on the email! Oh, fucking hell.

496
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.560
Why did you, why did you leave us on the dongle?

497
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.040
No, no, no no, no. No! No!

498
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.040
Because he's only supposed to send the fucking top part of it!

499
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.760
Why did you give him the choice?

500
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.360
Because an email has a chain, Fergus. It has a chain, and it goes all the way down.

501
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.600
Adam, there is now shit all over me! Oh, Jesus Christ!

502
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.400
How come there is shit on me? Thanks, Adam!

503
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.720
Look, it's not my fucking fault! He's supposed to redact it!

504
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.800
I just wanted one solid shit, to go in one direction.

505
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.360
Not Madras, fucking everywhere!

506
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.800
Alastair, yeah, it's Peter Mannion.

507
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.840
I just wanted to give you a nudge on this.

508
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.480
The real story here isn't all this jokey email nonsense,

509
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.200
it's that Mr Tickel's medical records were illegally acquired.

510
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.440
Yeah.

511
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.600
He's been the victim of Mr Blag.

512
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.120
OK. Bye.

513
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.560
Hi. I just...needed a pen.

514
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.160
Would you like a pen?

515
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.560
As a small recompense for the vital, vital work that you do...

516
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.040
I'll tell you what I'd like. I'd like a departmental in ten regarding leakage.

517
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.080
And as of now, your department's in lockdown.

518
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.880
No emailing, no Diving Bell and Butterflying,

519
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.760
no communication, nada!

520
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.040
Just a little piece of electric paper, that's all.

521
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.560
Off the record,

522
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.200
there are a number of machines that emails can be set to.

523
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.280
Why would I know anything about this email? Why me? Thank you.

524
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.760
PHONE RINGS

525
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.840
Comms. Off the phones. Now.

526
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.920
Oh, my...I think I've just perjured myself.

527
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.680
Can you perjure yourself on the phone, or is it only a court thing?

528
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.560
I'm so sorry for the delay. I promise it won't be much longer.

529
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.280
And that's not a political promise. That's a real promise. Ha-ha-ha!

530
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.600
Hey!

531
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.720
2,000-year-old man! Why the fuck did you send the whole email?! Huh?

532
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.320
You were supposed to redact it, send the top email,

533
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.040
not the whole fucking exchange.

534
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.480
Jesus Christ on a crystal meth binge!

535
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.680
Terri and I sent what you gave me.

536
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.040
Terri?!

537
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.800
Why the fuck... The only reason I'd ever ask Terri for help,

538
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.400
is to shoot me, if I ever ask Terri for help!

539
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.720
Same reason you gave it to me. Distance.

540
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.320
Two people! Twice the distance!

541
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.600
Terri doesn't give us any distance! Terri gives me a twitch! Right here!

542
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.720
Laugh it up, Glenn. I've got a twitch called Terri!

543
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.120
I am actually here, you know.

544
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.240
Yeah, and that, in a nutshell, is the whole fucking problem!

545
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.520
# Fuck you very much. #

546
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.280
Five minutes guys, yeah?

547
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.400
Thanks.

548
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.960
Glenn, what about my tea shop?

549
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.360
It got closed. There's been a murder.

550
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.640
An inquiry into all of leaking. All of leaking.

551
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.800
We are so...we are so screwed.

552
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.440
He's done it.

553
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.200
That chinless horse fiddler, our fucklustrious PM has opened

554
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.240
Pandora's fucking Box and curled a massive steamer right into it.

555
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.680
In the time it has taken for Terri to extract

556
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.520
herself from her Bluetooth, this little inquiry has fused!

557
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.240
It is now growing faster than the speed of bloody light!

558
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.960
It's not going to be something that we can see from space.

559
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.680
It's going to be space!

560
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.400
Brian Cox is going to phone me, and ask for the film rights!

561
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.840
But what leak, what leak, what fucking leak?!

562
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.640
Anything! If I find out that anyone from here has leaked anything,

563
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.320
I will make sure they have to emigrate after this, to a country

564
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.760
where they don't speak English and there's no internet.

565
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.280
But everyone who leaked anything,

566
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.400
that would fill the fucking Caspian Sea!

567
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.520
We're just a drop in the ocean here.

568
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.920
No, no, what you are Peter, is leak zero. It started here.

569
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.680
You have presided over a shambolic showering of info. Peter Mannion.

570
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.560
"Singin' in The Rain"

571
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.280
PHONE RINGS

572
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.960
Oh, Christ. Hello, Malcolm!

573
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.560
Right, was this your idea?

574
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.000
Because I don't remember signing any suicide pact.

575
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.960
Malcolm, look. I'm as shocked about this as you are.

576
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.520
Yes, you sound really shocked, you big fucking spunk lolly.

577
00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.840
I don't even know what that is.

578
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.800
But I, you know, I think we all need time to, to process this data, yep?

579
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.160
What the fuck is going on?!

580
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.840
All right, Fergus. What the fuck is going on?

581
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.200
The Ark has been opened. And your face is going to melt.

582
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.680
There's going to be an inquiry.

583
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.920
Have I just stepped through a portal into a sausage machine,

584
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.680
because this is making mince meat of my head.

585
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.600
It's the end of the world as we know it.

586
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.720
To paraphrase a popular fucking Bangles song.

587
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.920
It's... it's REM.

588
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.360
Don't start contradicting me on that kind of shit.

589
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.880
OK, Robyn, it's over to you. It's show time.

590
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.440
Let's just give it another five minutes.

591
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.280
There's still a blogger from the Huffington Post to come.

592
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.360
Is that it?

593
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.560
It looks like a paedophile's funeral.

594
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.160
It doesn't matter. We've got to get out of here ASAP.

595
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.200
Leaking is a fundamental component of our governmental system.

596
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.120
If a government can't leak, do you know what happens?

597
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.200
Dark shit builds up and then it bursts.

598
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.920
And that's something you don't want to see. You think your appendix was bad.

599
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.920
Hi, and welcome to the launch of Carer's Pass.

600
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.360
You know, we thought long and hard about how,

601
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.040
in these straitened times, we could help those

602
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.000
who don't help themselves, but rather help others.

603
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.440
Please give it up for The Carers.

604
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.720
This is the gift that's going to go on giving, believe you me. So you better keep your head down.

605
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.920
I don't mean just when you're frequenting your favourite glory holes.

606
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.360
Well, whereas your closet is completely free of skeletons isn't it, Malcolm?

607
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.800
Cos you've buried them in a landfill in Essex.

608
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.440
Oh, yeah, sorry, and just to say that we're very proud to say that

609
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.360
this, this policy has been pushed through by our party.

610
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.280
We do have a voice in this coalition, and it is being heard.

611
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.920
When this inquiry lands, you'd better have developed a very flat,

612
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.920
stony face with no expression. But that'll be easy for you.

613
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.600
It's your fucking come face, isn't it?

614
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.120
Hi, my name's Rohinka.

615
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.560
OK, when they dry up, just jump in. Do a quick Q&A and wrap it up, yeah?

616
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.560
Who am I? Fucking Kirsty Wark?

617
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.640
No.

618
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.920
..lead a normal life. So, this Carers Pass is a blessing, really.

619
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.080
I, Peter Mannion.

620
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.120
Stewart Pearson.

621
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.560
Fergus Williams. Adam Kenyon.

622
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.880
Emma Florence Messinger.

623
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.800
Philip Bartholomew Cornelius Smith.

624
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.320
Teresa Jessica Coverley.

625
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.520
Robyn Murdoch.

626
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.360
Glenn Cullen. Oliver Francis Reeder.

627
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.600
Nicola Alison Murray.

628
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.040
I, Malcolm Tucker, do declare that the evidence I give

629
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.600
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
