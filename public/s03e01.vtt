WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.160
This programme contains
discriminatory language, strong
language and adult humour

00:05.160 --> 00:09.680
We're offering Tom Rudd Northern
Ireland. He's expecting Transport.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.920
He's making Paul Remington
a Cabinet Minister.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.400
Remtard Remington.
I mean, the guy is an epic fuck-up.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.200
He's so dense
that light bends around him.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.240
Come on, people!
Let's get going here.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.040
I've got a to-do list
here that's longer than
a fucking Leonard Cohen song.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.680
Remtard at Energy
and Climate Change. Really?

00:27.680 --> 00:30.200
I'm not getting that.
It's not on here.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.920
How did you get
that about Remington?

00:31.920 --> 00:34.520
Refresh the page.

00:34.520 --> 00:38.200
Ah. Oh, look! Fatty's staying put.
They're not moving Fatty.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.160
That's because they haven't
got five big blokes and a winch.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.320
They couldn't really demote
Fatty because he knows too much.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.400
He doesn't know where
the Rivita's kept.
I've got this reshuffle going on,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.480
the Leamington Spa by-election
coming up.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.120
I've got more on my plate
than a spinster at a wedding.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.600
That wasn't a reference
to your daughter, Andrew.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.800
Well, that's Hugh gone, then.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.840
So sad, isn't it? Hugh.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.840
You don't give a shit.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.680
No, perhaps, I don't.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.240
Northern Ireland Office.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.240
Tom Rudd. Who's Tom Rudd?

01:10.240 --> 01:12.880
Isn't he in Harry Potter?

01:12.880 --> 01:15.840
Tom Rudd is army slang
for standing up buggery.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.080
Doug, Doug, Dougie! Look at you. Cock
the size of the Pink Panther's tail.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.760
Come and have a Kit Kat. I'm
afraid I turned it down, Malcolm.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.720
Do you know that 90% of household
dust is made of dead human skin?
That's what you are. To me.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.760
Doug Hayes is a massive abortion.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.800
Again, not a reference
to your daughter.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.240
We need somebody to plug
this DOSAC hole

01:36.240 --> 01:38.600
Anybody.
A fucking mammal with a head.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.240
Have you to finished
emptying your desks yet?

01:41.240 --> 01:42.840
Yes, don't worry, Terri.

01:42.840 --> 01:47.560
We're ready to go. I'm just trying
to get everything organised
for whenever whoever arrives.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.200
They are going to have
their own people.
It's going to be very embarrassing

01:51.200 --> 01:53.759
if your hand cream's
still in the drawer. Hand cream?!

01:53.759 --> 01:57.280
Whatever men have. I don't know,
electric nose hair trimmers. Ex-lax.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.080
Oh, look at Glenn.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.920
Your face. On the scrapheap
at the tender age of 76.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.160
It's no life for you,
is it, Glenn, this? Hey,
do you want me to call Dignitas?

02:09.160 --> 02:11.320
I could call Indignitas.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.720
They could come round
and shove you out of the
window dressed as a clown.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.320
Simon, Simon!

02:16.320 --> 02:18.800
Get me Nicola Murray. Yeah.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.960
If she says no, the only other
candidate's my left bollock

02:21.960 --> 02:23.880
with a fucking
smiley face drawn on it.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.680
Ladies and gentlemen, may I

02:23.880 --> 02:27.680
introduce the new Secretary of State

02:27.680 --> 02:32.280
for the Department of Social Affairs
and Citizenship, Nicola Murray.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.440
Thank you. Hello.
I'm Nicola. Lovely to meet you.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.360
Hello. I'm Glenn Cullen.
Hello, Ken. Lovely to meet you.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.040
Oliver Reeder. Ollie.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.120
These are just Hugh's,
previous incumbent's...

02:45.120 --> 02:49.160
So it's Ken and... Ollie Reeder.
Are you an Ollie or an Oliver?

02:49.160 --> 02:51.480
Whichever you prefer.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.480
OK, well, I like the name Oliver.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.079
Ollie.

02:55.079 --> 02:58.440
Oh, you are an Ollie. I don't know
why I said that. I'm the ideas man.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.120
PHONE RINGS

03:00.120 --> 03:02.080
Sorry. I just need one second.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.120
Yes, I know.
They frogmarched me into it.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.000
I didn't know. I had no idea.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.920
James, be fair. I left seven
fucking messages for you.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.000
Your secretary or whoever is useless.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.040
I don't think
the school thing's a problem.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.520
It's not because they'll
have vetted me at Number Ten.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.320
And obviously nobody has
soiled themselves or shot me.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.079
Great. Well, I'll take you
warm congratulations as implied.

03:26.079 --> 03:28.840
Fucking arsehole.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.160
All right? Yes, it's all bit crazy.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.800
It just feels like my head's
made entirely of smoke alarms.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.360
It's all a bit, aah!

03:36.360 --> 03:40.600
Well, it was a bit of a shock for us
all. Well, you know, in a good way.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.600
Like twins or a tax rebate.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.520
Yes, let me continue with the tour.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.120
That's such a nice chair.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.480
This was Glenn's office. Any chance
of getting something like that?

03:50.480 --> 03:55.920
Would you like it moved to your
office? That would be great.
Can you do that? Right, Ollie.

03:55.920 --> 04:01.640
Glenn and Ollie, what I need to know
from you really is all the stuff
that Terri's not going to tell me.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.720
Oh, huge list!
Where the bodies are buried.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.680
Yes, the play-pits.
The big cardboard boxes full
of bits of old junior minister.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.280
I'll just go and sort out
that policy list.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.680
Lovely! Urban renewal is a bit
of a running sore. In what way?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.320
Well, it's very woolly and big.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.720
Sounds like a mammoth!

04:18.720 --> 04:20.360
HE LAUGHS

04:20.360 --> 04:22.920
Right. OK.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.360
So, my big thing...

04:26.360 --> 04:31.480
Come in, actually.
Come in to my office with
nowhere to sit or put anything.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.159
My primary focus is social mobility.

04:34.159 --> 04:36.800
That's very much my big thing.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.120
I suppose I'm telling you that
partly to get your take on it,

04:40.120 --> 04:44.159
and also so that you can
start spreading the news
and printing the posters

04:44.159 --> 04:46.800
and, you know,
fire up the turbo-chargers.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.720
Set the phasers to equality.

04:48.720 --> 04:53.560
It's Murray time!
The thing is, and Ollie please
correct me here if I'm wrong...

04:53.560 --> 04:54.880
I will certainly do that.

04:54.880 --> 04:59.920
Social mobility, making
people richer, costs money.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.120
Yes, and we don't have
any of that, really.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.680
If you speak to Nick at the
Treasury, he will tell that.
Only with his annoying lisp.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.080
What you're telling me is that
basically I'm going to be a woman
with a computer and some pens.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.480
Well, if there's the pen budget! I
mean, I have about as much real power

05:16.480 --> 05:20.280
as those twats who sit
either side of Alan Sugar.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.880
Well...yes.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.320
We have got some clothes
for you to look at
for a press photograph later.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.640
We can continue this later, maybe?

05:29.640 --> 05:32.360
Yeah, definitely. You're a size 16?

05:32.360 --> 05:37.600
I'm 12. I'm so sorry. Well,
I'll get those changed, right away.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.760
At the moment,
I've got nobody at all.

05:43.760 --> 05:50.680
Apart from Hugh's guys
who are just, kind of,
so fucking patronising and cold.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.480
Seriously, one of them

05:52.480 --> 05:56.159
looks exactly like
he works in menswear at Selfridges.

05:56.159 --> 05:58.320
I don't know what
the fuck to say to him.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.040
Secretary of State?

06:00.040 --> 06:03.280
Your fruit salad. Oh, I've just
had a couple of press calls.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.600
A couple of the papers asking
about your husband and the PFI.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.840
Already?

06:08.840 --> 06:12.360
My God! They're so...
They're so on it.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.000
Could you brief me? Yes, sorry.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.080
It's honestly nothing.

06:17.080 --> 06:23.200
James works for Albany, which is
the company that was awarded the PFI
prisons contract by this department.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.640
I know that sounds bad.
But actually James wasn't at Albany

06:26.640 --> 06:30.240
when the contracts were awarded
and I wasn't here. Yeah, maybe.

06:30.240 --> 06:35.120
I think you
could just run that by Malcolm.
And he's on his way. Not Malcolm.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.680
What, now? Coming in...
Yes, he'll be up in 25 seconds.

06:39.680 --> 06:45.120
OK. Fuck, right. So Malcolm Tucker,
Malcolm Tucker,
Malcolm Tucker. Malcolm.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.920
I'm not nervous. It's just Malcolm's
sort of one of those things

06:49.920 --> 06:54.640
that I'm aware of without ever having

06:49.920 --> 06:54.640
really come into contact with.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.200
Like a rat.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.040
No, he'd take that.
He thinks of himself more as a
sort of thin, white Mugabe.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.640
Do you think? Because if you are
worried about Malcolm,

07:03.640 --> 07:07.480
we have amassed a few tips

07:03.640 --> 07:07.480
how to deal with him over the years.

07:07.480 --> 07:12.200
We have worked out when he's going
to give you a verbal colonic
and some avoidance manoeuvres.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.720
Tai Kwon spin.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.120
Is this the number one
ladies detective agency?

07:17.120 --> 07:19.760
Malcolm Tucker. The real deal. Hello.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.960
The real deal. Good to see you.
You're looking great.

07:21.960 --> 07:26.080
All right, hinge and bracket, time
to go and hang up your ladycocks.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.680
Nicola Murray.
Here you are, Secretary of State

07:28.680 --> 07:31.600
for the Department of
Social Affairs and Citizenship.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.640
Yup. I now have one of the longest
job titles in western politics.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.880
Thank God I don't have
to wear a lapel badge.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.800
It's a pity we couldn't make
an abbreviation of it,
you know, like PFI.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.920
Which I think stands for
Pretty Fucking Embarrassing.

07:44.920 --> 07:49.360
If you're a bit sloppy about
the details, which clearly
your fucking husband is.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.840
James works for Albany.
He wasn't working
there when the contract was awarded.

07:53.840 --> 08:00.280
Don't worry. That was just me.
That's the sort of thing
the press will throw at you.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.840
You step out of line, they'll be all
over you. Like a pigeon on a chip.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.960
Is that your chair?

08:04.960 --> 08:07.960
Oh, God, yeah. It's cool, isn't it?

08:07.960 --> 08:09.720
It's got lumbar support.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.920
Bin it. People don't like their
politicians to be comfortable.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.600
They don't like you having expenses

08:12.920 --> 08:15.600
or being paid.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.840
They'd rather you
lived in a fucking cave.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.520
OK. Fine.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.680
So, what should I be sitting on?

08:21.680 --> 08:24.000
Should I just get an
upturned KFC bucket?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.400
Just a fucking normal chair. Right?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.040
Not a fucking massive
vibrating throne.

08:29.040 --> 08:34.840
Malcolm must be hating this. All
these bright fresh new ministers to
blood-in and to plan a by-election.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.080
If it's any consolation,
a little bit of you

08:37.080 --> 08:40.640
will always be in this department
because she's nabbed your chair.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.880
She's got your chair and
in fact your dandruff. Ha ha ha(!)

08:43.880 --> 08:46.920
If I go, that chair is coming with
me. You know those old men you see

08:46.920 --> 08:49.480
who go to the park to read
the paper? That will be you.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.520
You could go in your chair. They'd
make you king of all the tramps.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.400
So you've got three kids, yeah?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.600
I've got four. Four!

08:57.600 --> 08:59.520
Katie's 16. She's the eldest.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.200
She's just left school.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.880
Not going to college or university?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.480
She's a bit of a rebel.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.720
What sort of a rebel?
What are we talking here?

09:08.720 --> 09:12.400
Are we talking a pierced navel or
holidays at Pakistani training camp?

09:12.400 --> 09:15.040
It's chiefly heroin.

09:15.040 --> 09:19.800
Although she has cut down
since getting pregnant by
that Nigerian people-smuggler

09:19.800 --> 09:22.840
because the track-marks would
have affected her porn career.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.720
I'm sorry to disturb.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.760
Morning, Malcolm.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.120
Just wanted give you a few
things here.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.240
That's change from the fruit salad.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.800
This is this morning's papers.
Do excuse me.

09:33.800 --> 09:38.960
I'm surprised that you
hadn't vetted me.
I thought you'd know about the kids.

09:38.960 --> 09:44.200
It's just that because you were
just a sort of late-ish kind of
appointment, that didn't quite

09:44.200 --> 09:48.560
give me the time to fuck the
Is and fist the Ts, as
Robert Robinson might say.

09:48.560 --> 09:53.520
Sounds to me like she's only
bringing in one other person.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.520
So I wonder whether she might
keep one of us on permanently.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.400
Thank God, I'm safe. Jee...

09:58.400 --> 10:01.200
We know you're safe, Terri!
How do we know you're safe?

10:01.200 --> 10:05.360
We know you were safe because
you keep using the word safe
like bloody Jim Bowen.

10:05.360 --> 10:09.600
You've got DOSAC, that's safe.
Do you want to go for
the Treasury, young lady?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.840
OK. Mrs Walton.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.560
What about these other kids?
What ages are they?

10:13.560 --> 10:16.440
They're 11, nine and five.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.720
11?

10:17.720 --> 10:20.320
Mm-hmm.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.680
So that's secondary school.
No, she's still at primary.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.240
State primary.

10:25.240 --> 10:31.560
Lovely little school with
terrible SATS results but really good
broad demographic and steel band.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.680
She will be going to
secondary school in September?

10:34.680 --> 10:36.080
Yeah. Yeah.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.400
So, I can see where this is going.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.200
Em, it's not an issue. Great!

10:42.200 --> 10:44.920
If it's not an issue,
I'll fucking toddle off.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.840
I'll go and have a nice
relaxing wee sleep under my duvet.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.200
I won't tug myself off
because I'm so relaxed

10:50.200 --> 10:53.560
because I know that there is
no fucking issue here, right?

10:53.560 --> 10:56.400
She's not going to the
comprehensive, Malcolm.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.480
She's going to a local
independent school.

10:59.480 --> 11:03.920
Jesus H fucking Corbett!

11:03.920 --> 11:08.720
Do you honestly believe that as a
minister you can get away with that?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.560
You are saying that

11:10.560 --> 11:15.320
all your local state schools, all
the schools that this government

11:15.320 --> 11:20.560
has drastically improved,
are knife-addled rape sheds
and that's not a big story?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.480
For fuck's sake.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.760
Sort it or of abort it.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.360
Let's get this clear.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.160
My family is off-limits. All right?

11:29.160 --> 11:33.080
This job is not going to get anywhere

11:29.160 --> 11:33.080
near my husband and my kids.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.400
It just doesn't.
Of course it fucking does!

11:35.400 --> 11:38.040
As per the wee barcode
and the serial number

11:38.040 --> 11:43.280
under your right armpit, you are now

11:38.040 --> 11:43.280
built and owned by the state.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.240
And you are under the
spotlight 24 hours a day, darling.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.200
Do you know what you are?

11:49.200 --> 11:51.640
You're a fucking human dartboard.

11:51.640 --> 11:57.200
And Eric fucking Bristow is on
the oche, flinging a million darts
made of human shit right at you.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.800
Can you take that?

11:58.800 --> 12:05.360
Can you? You, the all-swearing
eye, you didn't even know how many
kids I had. You had to ask me.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.040
So who on earth in the press
is going to either know or care?

12:08.040 --> 12:10.440
Do you remember The Big Breakfast?
You remember it?

12:10.440 --> 12:12.840
You remember how Chris Evans
started that?

12:12.840 --> 12:14.520
You remember it was a big success?

12:14.520 --> 12:17.000
And then they had that
guy Johnny Vaughan. Remember?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.600
Everybody loved him.
Fuck knows why, but they did.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.200
Do you know what this is here?

12:21.200 --> 12:27.280
This here is fucking series 10
of The Big Breakfast.
And do you know what you are?

12:27.280 --> 12:31.280
You're the fucking dinnerlady
that they have asked to
come and present the show.

12:31.280 --> 12:38.920
The reason that I didn't know about

12:31.280 --> 12:38.920
you and your children is cos you

12:31.280 --> 12:38.920
were so low down

12:38.920 --> 12:44.120
on the list of candidates for this
job I didn't even have
the chance to look into you.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.760
So low.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.720
Way, way, way, way, way...

12:52.560 --> 12:53.600
Low.

12:54.640 --> 13:01.000
You are now being scrutinised
for what you wear, what you say,
for your hair, your shoes,

13:01.000 --> 13:05.640
your fucking earrings, your fucking

13:01.000 --> 13:05.640
cleavage and your dress - which,

13:01.000 --> 13:05.640
by the way, is WAY too loud.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.200
Too loud?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.120
Yeah, I'm getting tinnitus here.

13:11.680 --> 13:16.480
Look, your crooked husband,
I can make go away.

13:16.480 --> 13:20.960
But your crooked husband combined
with you being worried

13:20.960 --> 13:24.440
about your under-age daughter coming

13:20.960 --> 13:24.440
home up the duff

13:24.440 --> 13:27.600
from some truanting bastard,
I cannot.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.560
She goes to the comp, OK?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.040
Oh, God!

13:36.040 --> 13:40.400
You, Glenn. And or Ollie.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.800
Terri, just a quick update, really.
How did it go?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.880
Em, it was all very positive.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.400
We sort of know where we all stand
now. The PFI thing you know about.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.040
Not a problem. Malcolm's fine.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.280
Second thing I've
just apprised Malcolm of

13:52.280 --> 13:56.360
is that my 11-year-old daughter
will be going to a private school.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.640
Oh, for fuck's sake.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.880
Sorry. OK, it's a personal issue.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.760
I'm not Education Secretary, so...

14:02.760 --> 14:08.120
Nor will you be.
Secretary of State, with respect,
this is political suicide.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.920
Thank you, Glenn(!) I was hoping
there might be a way round this.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.760
I'm sorry, there is no way
around it. It's horrible.
It's a bit like Dover.

14:14.760 --> 14:18.720
You know, if you want to go to
France, you've got go through it.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.240
No, you could go
through Weymouth, Portsmouth...

14:21.240 --> 14:24.120
I don't want
to go to fucking Dover or France. 

14:24.120 --> 14:28.280
I just want my daughter to be happy.
Great. Well, that's good.
That's excellent.

14:28.280 --> 14:33.200
That's a super message to send out.
It shows you've got principles...
For fuck's sake, Ollie.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.760
No point telling her just
what she wants to hear.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.120
Also, Terri? I'm sorry, but
personal issues are not my brief.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.280
OK, thank you for that.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.880
The chair, the lumber chair,
has to go in the skip.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.480
Malcolm insisted.
Not now, because I've got work to do.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.040
But if you could get somebody.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.080
Apparently,
if you have a nice chair it

14:51.080 --> 14:52.720
turns you into Saddam Hussein.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.400
This entire building
smells of coleslaw.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.800
So, first Cabinet meeting.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.800
How do you feel?
Anxious, nervous, worried?

15:02.800 --> 15:07.360
Not until you said, "Anxious,
nervous, worried?", like you're
an advert for temazepam.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.720
If I'm sick all over the Foreign
Secretary, would that look bad?

15:09.720 --> 15:13.640
No. Geoffrey Howe shat himself on
his first morning. Ollie, please!

15:13.640 --> 15:16.480
Well, I find that
kind of tomfoolery very tiresome...

15:16.480 --> 15:17.880
What's the driver's name?

15:17.880 --> 15:23.120
Always makes you look more
human if you know their name
and I am human, so... It's Elvis.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.400
Seriously, what's his name?
It's Elvis.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.160
He's from the Ukraine, you see,

15:28.160 --> 15:34.400
and nobody can pronounce the

15:28.160 --> 15:34.400
real name, so they call him

15:28.160 --> 15:34.400
Elvis on account of the...uh-hu-huh.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.680
What? Take a peek.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.640
What's wrong? You look like
you've shat a Lego garage.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.480
Jim Leighton's daughter's standing
as an independent in Leamington Spa.

15:45.480 --> 15:49.680
Fuck.
This is going to split our vote.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.960
Are we in trouble? Maybe we should
have chosen her over Liam Bentley?

15:52.960 --> 15:55.840
No, she thinks just because
her dead fat-arse dad was an MP,

15:55.840 --> 15:57.880
she has the right
to be our candidate. No.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.280
This isn't Tsarist Russia
or the fucking Dimblebys!

16:00.280 --> 16:03.920
What do we do? Send everyone
to support Liam Bentley,
including the Prime Minister.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.640
You want to send Tom up there?
He'll be all right as long
as he doesn't do the smile.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.560
You hit the phones.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.880
I'll be with you in two
shakes of a crying baby.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.200
Wow! The black widow.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.520
Malcolm.
Congratulations. First Cabinet.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.200
I heard you wowed them.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.760
The meeting's just finished.
How would you know that?

16:22.760 --> 16:24.600
PM texted me. He was very impressed.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.120
You could be nominated
for best newcomer. Really?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.160
No.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.640
You knew Jim Leighton, didn't you?

16:30.640 --> 16:33.760
The dead fucker. God rest him.
Yeah, I did a bit, back home.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.600
Very sad. All those weeks
on life support. Nice chair.

16:37.600 --> 16:42.720
Sad? Lying on your back getting
fed nutrients through a tube?
It's my idea of a fucking holiday.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.720
How would you like
to go to Leamington?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.360
When?

16:46.360 --> 16:48.080
This morning.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.760
It's never too soon
to go to Leamington.
I've just taken over a department.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.040
I have a hell of a lot... You're
being asked by the PM specifically

16:55.040 --> 17:00.560
to pop along to Leamington and do
some photo-ops with Liam Bentley,
supporting him, yeah?

17:00.560 --> 17:02.840
I don't really have
any choice, do I?

17:02.840 --> 17:06.800
Of course you have a choice. You
can decide exactly how you say yes.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.839
You can do with a voice.
Have fun with it.

17:11.040 --> 17:16.560
Yes. In my own voice. I look
forward to toasting your success.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.440
Have a lovely time
in Leamington, yeah?

17:19.440 --> 17:21.640
Can I go?
Of course, you can fucking go.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.240
Jesus. Never easy.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.680
Never fucking easy.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.360
Yeah. Hi. Come in.

17:32.360 --> 17:38.480
Um, yeah. Glynn. Glenn.
What do you think of Glenn?

17:38.480 --> 17:43.400
Well, it's sort of like asking what
do I think of skirting boards.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.880
I assume that we need them,
but I'm not sure why.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.360
I'm finding him very old school.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.720
Yes, he's ancient school,
really, Glenn.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.640
He used to get his packed lunch
nicked by Plato. He's an old...

17:53.640 --> 17:55.840
So, I'd like you to come
up to Leamington with me.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.960
Great. Yeah. Well, it's
my favourite of the spa towns.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.160
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

18:01.160 --> 18:02.920
Apart from all the others, so...

18:02.920 --> 18:06.560
OK. Lovely.
If you just get Terri in, please.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.440
Sure.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.640
Terri. Yeah? You're on.

18:11.640 --> 18:17.520
What? What were you and Bravo
Two Zero talking about in there?

18:17.520 --> 18:19.120
Who?

18:19.120 --> 18:21.360
Her in there. Bravo Two Zero.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.360
I don't know what that means, Glenn.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.240
Yes, you do. No, I don't mean that.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.360
I mean Juliet Bravo.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.800
You've completely lost me, Glenn.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.520
Juliet Bravo!
She was a lady policeman.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.760
A lady policeman?! Did the last
30 years not happen to you? What?

18:36.760 --> 18:40.880
Have you been asleep in a box full
of straw like a Blue Peter tortoise?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.440
Lady policeman?!

18:42.440 --> 18:46.640
I've asked Ollie to come
up to Leamington with me. Ollie?

18:46.640 --> 18:49.120
I can't really connect with Glenn.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.840
Um...

18:51.840 --> 18:55.600
You think I shouldn't have asked
Ollie. No, no. I didn't say that.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
You sort of did with your face.

18:57.600 --> 19:03.240
No, Ollie has got plenty
of good points it's just
he's a little bit morally bankrupt

19:03.240 --> 19:08.280
and massively self-centred and
a tiny bit dangerously unreliable.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.680
But he has got a lot
of good points, as I say.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.360
Great. Well, thank you.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.920
Can you just send Glenn in for me?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.880
Glenn?

19:15.880 --> 19:18.480
Nicola would like to see you.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.640
Hi, Glenn. Take a seat.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.600
Have you ever worked
in retail, Glenn?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.560
No. Never have.

19:33.080 --> 19:38.280
So, what do you think of Terri?
Do you trust her?

19:38.280 --> 19:40.240
No.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.800
Right.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.960
Because she just told me she sort
of prefers you to Ollie.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.520
When I say I don't trust her...

19:51.040 --> 19:54.000
..what I mean is I don't
trust her around money.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.880
Really?

19:55.880 --> 19:59.440
What? She steals? No, no, no.
I'm not saying anything like that.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.560
Because actually I got very little
change from my fruit salad.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.040
No, let me just row
back a little bit here.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.880
Perhaps all the way
to the boathouse.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.120
Actually, I do trust Terri.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.360
OK.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.960
Your chair's gone. Yeah, I had
to bin it. Malcolm insisted.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.600
But it was MY chair. Right.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.880
It was decadent, Glenn.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.120
It was a chair gone mad.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.120
Do you know where it's gone?

20:32.360 --> 20:33.800
Skip.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.360
Skip.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.480
I'm really...
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.800
I paid £600 for that chair.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.320
How's the hair?
Terri, you'll be delighted to know

20:51.320 --> 20:54.400
that the Secretary of State is now
checking her hair in my glasses.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.360
You're on TV live.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.000
What? Now?
You're on now, apparently.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.640
Why are you squatting down? 
Ah, there she is.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.680
Malcolm, Nicola will
be there in a minute.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.640
You're in the shot, actually, Ollie.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.640
Why am I in-shot?

21:07.640 --> 21:09.680
..Nicola Murray.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.680
Thank you. Hi, everybody.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.440
Well, I'm very pleased to see a
number of familiar faces here. Hello.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.240
Isn't she good with the people?

21:17.240 --> 21:20.720
Yes, she is, but then so
is Kate Thornton and she's
wanted for war crimes.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.880
Ladies and gentlemen, let's take
a look at Liam Bentley's
election poster.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.400
Mrs Murray, do you feel
your husband's involvement

21:27.400 --> 21:30.160
in the PFI prisons contract
compromises your position?

21:30.160 --> 21:32.360
I'm just here
to support Liam Bentley.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.800
You don't feel there's a conflict
of interest? No, I really don't.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.280
She's handling this
very well, Malcolm.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.960
Don't you think?
Are you going to resign, Minister?

21:40.960 --> 21:45.600
Oh, shut up, you twat.
I think they're interested

21:45.600 --> 21:48.400
in greater opportunities
for social...

21:48.400 --> 21:50.280
Does she look...? What?

21:50.280 --> 21:54.080
Little bit edgy. Can you please make
sure Nicola's right in the middle?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.960
She doesn't look important enough.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.600
Can you just move her over?

21:57.600 --> 22:00.560
Can you just move for a second?

22:00.560 --> 22:03.320
About here? Perfect. No, no, no.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.480
Jesus, Terri. The letters.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.400
What does it say, Terri!?

22:07.400 --> 22:10.080
It says Liam...Bentley. 
No, it doesn't.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.680
Not there, it fucking doesn't.

22:11.680 --> 22:18.160
Whoa! Back where you were, please.
Uh, OK. This is obviously
the hot spot!

22:18.160 --> 22:21.040
Well, OK, if you cropped it.
Of course, if you crop. Malcolm!

22:21.040 --> 22:24.840
You tried. You really tried.
You did your best, mate.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.080
You both did your best. Thanks.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.080
Big smile.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.440
Hi, darling.
Did you see Mummy on the telly?

22:33.440 --> 22:35.200
I know. Did I look funny?

22:36.920 --> 22:40.320
It did. Good boy.
It said, "I am bent".

22:44.280 --> 22:48.520
Have you...? Yes. We're currently
in a no-commenting situation.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.240
Is this now official
nuisance calling?

22:52.240 --> 22:56.600
Great. Someone's just sent
me a YouTube clip which is me
in front of the "I am bent" sign

22:56.600 --> 22:59.680
randomly intercut with
bits from Family Guy.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.440
It's not even funny. Why do
people fucking do that on YouTube?

23:02.440 --> 23:06.120
Look, let's learn
and grow from this experience.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.680
We can make a blacklist of words
you should never stand in front of,

23:09.680 --> 23:12.080
in case the press get to
do something like this.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.040
Peacock. Shuttlecock.
Spatchcock. Anything cock, really.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.840
Do you remember that
folk singer Tim Harding?

23:17.840 --> 23:20.520
You'd be able to get "I'm hard"
out of that.

23:20.520 --> 23:24.520
Coarse fishing. That could be
"arse fish" if you crop that.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.240
Walkie-talkie could be
cropped to see "Alkie" twice. 

23:27.240 --> 23:28.440
There are no...

23:28.440 --> 23:31.880
Why would I stand in front of a
walkie-talkie sign? Malcie, Malcie.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.880
You know what,
Howard, she's not bent.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.280
Either in the sense of
being corrupt or being gay.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.520
By the way, that's an incredibly
homophobic headline,
you massive poof.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.520
You've got egg on your face, Howard.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.360
You over-easy pissbag.

23:43.360 --> 23:47.000
Oh, hey, Yoko Ono and the two
remaining Beatles, piss off.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.680
Right, any chance we could just skip
over the usual abuse bit and move
onto the part where we sort this out?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.960
Yeah. You need to make a decision.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.280
Are you still going
ahead with the private school

23:57.280 --> 24:01.600
because if you are we need
a statement saying that
your husband is leaving his job.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.960
Are you taking the piss?

24:03.960 --> 24:08.640
You're expecting me to choose between
fucking up my daughter's life
or my husband's life?

24:08.640 --> 24:15.960
Yeah. So I just have to choose
between them like they're on some
fucking cosmic dessert trolley?

24:15.960 --> 24:17.920
I can't fight on two fronts,
you know.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.720
If the press run with both
stories, you're fucking dead.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.640
You set this up, didn't you?

24:23.560 --> 24:24.840
What?

24:24.840 --> 24:31.280
To put me in my place or get
back at me for ignoring your advice?

24:31.280 --> 24:35.440
Or some other weird perceived slight
that doesn't in any way merit

24:35.440 --> 24:39.120
this massive fucking out of
proportion Israeli-style response.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.120
You don't realise, I'm your fucking
fairy godfather, right? God help me.

24:43.120 --> 24:47.640
I'm your fairy fucking godfather,
but I haven't got a magic wand
that I can wave about.

24:47.640 --> 24:51.840
I've got a fucking Blackberry
and a chiff. You've got a decision
to make. Talk to you later.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.720
Malcolm? Sorry,

24:54.720 --> 24:58.440
could we carry on
talking about that thing?
Was it you who positioned me there?

24:58.440 --> 25:01.680
Do you know what the
first sign of madness is?

25:01.680 --> 25:03.240
Paranoia.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.800
Have you seen that film,
A Beautiful Mind,
with Russell Crowe?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.120
The one where the maths guy
thinks that the CIA

25:09.120 --> 25:13.080
are working away in this shed at the
bottom of his garden. That's you.

25:13.080 --> 25:16.760
No. I'm not the mad one here.
You are the mad one.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.040
You're Russell Crowe. No, no, no.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.760
YOU are Russell Crowe.

25:20.760 --> 25:27.280
And you need to fucking listen to
me, Russell, you fucking Antipodean
fucking kangaroo-loving fruitcake.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.000
See this poster stuff.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.960
That's fucking small fry.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.080
That's whitebait,
Russ, me old cobber.

25:33.080 --> 25:36.600
The really horrible stuff,
that's all still about
to happen to you, right?

25:36.600 --> 25:39.640
Right, are you coming in
here so we can carry this on?

25:39.640 --> 25:41.280
What, now?

25:41.280 --> 25:43.400
If you can spare the time!

25:43.400 --> 25:45.120
Uh, no.

25:45.120 --> 25:49.720
No. I can't. I don't use lifts.
I'm claustrophobic.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.240
You're what?!

25:55.240 --> 25:57.000
Not hugely. I can be in rooms.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.760
You've seen that.
I just don't do lifts. That's all.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.960
But this lift,
I mean, it's fuckng huge.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.600
This is bigger than some rooms. This
is bigger than some people's flats.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.240
It's about not being able to get out.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.280
Oh. Well, that's great.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.520
That's fucking great.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.720
That's another fucking
thing right there.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.280
Not only have you got a fucking
bent husband and a fucking
daughter that gets taken to school

26:20.280 --> 26:24.320
in a fuckng sedan chair,
you're also fucking mental.
Jesus Christ, see you,

26:24.320 --> 26:27.400
you are a fucking
omni-shambles, that's what you are.

26:27.400 --> 26:31.880
You're like that coffee
machine, you know,
"From bean to cup, you fuck up."

26:33.240 --> 26:35.160
He SO is Russell Crowe.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.120
Who?

26:38.120 --> 26:43.160
Nicola. I did want
to tell you that I did try to
get a message through to Ollie.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.600
I know. I've
been doing this a long time now.

26:46.600 --> 26:50.720
By which, I mean in an experienced
firm hand on the tiller sort of way,

26:50.720 --> 26:54.160
not in a clapped-out over the hill
kind of way.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.560
Yeah, I know. I've learned to
look out for these sort of things.

26:57.560 --> 27:02.480
I have developed a kind of
sonar for them now, like a bat.

27:02.480 --> 27:06.640
Glenn, do you want to maybe stay on?

27:06.640 --> 27:10.600
I could use that sonar, batty man.
Right.

27:10.600 --> 27:15.560
Uh, forgive me, I think that's
Jamaican slang for homosexual.

27:15.560 --> 27:19.680
I was thinking that as
I said it. I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean... No, no, no.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.920
Right.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.600
I'm on my way down to see you
by the front door of the office.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.640
Have you decided?

27:30.640 --> 27:35.960
Oh, shit. Yes, Malcolm, you know
I have. I decided the minute
you told me I had to decide.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.000
I'm going to change Ella's schools.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.720
Good for you.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.360
I'm going to try to get
your social mobility thing moving.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.120
I'll talk to the Chancellor
and I'm going to keep
banging away at it.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.680
Like Charles Hawtrey
on a sleeping guardsman.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.360
OK.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.440
She's very bright, so...

27:52.440 --> 27:56.640
They say if you're very bright
then it sort of doesn't matter
what school you go to.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.440
That's true.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.040
That is very true.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.960
Hey!

28:01.960 --> 28:05.280
See you later, state educator.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.080
It's a highly expensive
lumbar-support chair,

28:10.080 --> 28:12.600
for God's sake.
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

28:12.600 --> 28:14.520
I mean, that's paper recycling.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.200
It's not going to be there, is it?

28:16.200 --> 28:17.720
I'll call you in the morning

28:17.720 --> 28:20.160
and if you're not there,
you're in big trouble.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.360
Glenn, see this

28:23.360 --> 28:28.760
Dickensian hysteric who's just gone
home, here's what you do, right.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.280
You make like the Great Oz, yeah?

28:30.280 --> 28:33.760
You make a big noise
to impress Nicola,

28:33.760 --> 28:37.120
but secretly you're
wanking behind the curtain to me

28:37.120 --> 28:40.240
all the time. You want me
to pass information to you?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.760
Don't kill yourself, though.
Well, not over this.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.960
I just want you
to make her feel good, you know.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.880
You can be a friend of
Dorothy's, can't you?

28:48.880 --> 28:53.640
Then we'll all get some fucking
peace around here.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.360
Right, I'm away to wipe my arse
on pictures of Nick Robinson.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.800
I'm getting good.
I can give him a quiff.
