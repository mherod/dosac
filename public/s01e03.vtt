WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:09.040
This programme contains
very strong language.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.400
..Ollie, did you see him
when I said your thing

00:12.400 --> 00:17.680
about the Opposition, "home is
where the heart is"? It almost hurt!
I loved it! He didn't even get it!

00:17.680 --> 00:22.120
He did. He flinched! He was hating
it! Fiddling with his catheter!

00:22.120 --> 00:26.160
A satisfactory report-stage debate.
Only three amendments in committee.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.080
How many did Doug's piece of shit
get at report? God, at least 200.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.320
Then it got fucked in the Lords. It
was more amendment than Bill, in the
end. We're doing a press release?

00:36.320 --> 00:41.560
Yes... "Following a successful
report-stage debate, the Secretary
of State for Social Affairs,

00:41.560 --> 00:43.880
"Hugh Abbot, today announced...

00:43.880 --> 00:45.920
"I'm the fuckin' daddy!"

00:47.520 --> 00:51.800
There was a SMARMY piece in The
Guardian, though. Did you see it?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.640
Dan fucking Miller! Yeah.

00:53.640 --> 00:59.000
"Ooh, all the work I've done on the
Standing Committee." Fine. My pie is
extremely large, as you may notice.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.160
Pie for all my friends! Yeah.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.360
"My Jacuzzi is king-sized
and everybody can...

01:04.360 --> 01:08.039
"plonk their asses
on the bubble-jets..."

01:08.039 --> 01:10.120
Is that from something? No.

01:10.120 --> 01:16.160
Dan Miller is a junior minister and
he's not done at all badly. Just
a bit green. Now... You turning...

01:16.160 --> 01:21.800
..a bit green yourself there,
minister? What're you saying? What
you saying? You saying I'm jealous?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.120
No, it's just a...little thing.

01:24.120 --> 01:29.160
You know those invisible lines...?
Yeah. ..you just stepped over it...
The problem with it being invisible.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.200
..again. Um, I...

01:31.200 --> 01:35.080
have...just been invited to...
KNOCK AT DOOR

01:35.080 --> 01:39.600
DANNY BOY! 

01:35.080 --> 01:39.600
< Oh, lovely(!)

01:35.080 --> 01:39.600
Man of the hour! 

01:39.600 --> 01:41.759
..just been invited to...

01:41.759 --> 01:44.360
Gorgeous!

01:41.759 --> 01:44.360
Lovely to see you. 

01:44.360 --> 01:47.600
Well done! You did so bloody well.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.600
Thank you! 

01:47.600 --> 01:52.640
You're looking well!

01:47.600 --> 01:52.640
Fantastic! Could you do

01:47.600 --> 01:52.640
GMTV for me tomorrow?

01:52.640 --> 01:57.280
I'd love to do GMTV for you tomorrow.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.280
Dan... Thank you very much!

01:52.640 --> 01:57.280
Nice and early. 

01:57.280 --> 01:59.920
No, no, I don't mind.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.920
Thanks so much.

01:59.920 --> 02:06.360
How are you doing? Good? Well,

01:59.920 --> 02:06.360
the debate did got very well and

01:59.920 --> 02:06.360
the bill's going through, so... Um...

02:06.360 --> 02:08.560
I've got stuff I need... No, fine.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.240
..I have been invited...

02:08.560 --> 02:12.240
How are you, Glenn? Good, thank you.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.800
Actually... ..I thought you were
heavy-handed with the backbenchers.
No need for it nowadays. Glenn.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.720
You know as well as I do,
if you're gonna make an omelette,

02:21.720 --> 02:25.280
you're going to have to have frank
and honest discussion with the eggs.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.880
That's all I was doing.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.880
MOBILE RINGS

02:29.120 --> 02:32.520
Hello, Malcolm!
'Dan! How are you doing?!'

02:32.520 --> 02:36.360
'How are YOU, you terrier?'
Listen, I'm just calling because...

02:36.360 --> 02:40.400
'you're gathering a lot of very
influential admirers.' Oh, really?

02:40.400 --> 02:43.920
You're irresistible,
you know that? You are.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.360
I have a sort of feeling
you're pulling my pisser. No,
I wouldn't pull YOUR pisser, pal.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.120
I know where it's fucking been.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.320
'Listen, I've got to go,

02:51.120 --> 02:55.320
I've got Tom on my other line.' OK.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.360
We'll talk soon.
Thanks for the DVDs, by the way.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.800
Oh, before you go, can you...? N...

03:02.800 --> 03:06.720
Did you get bumped for someone more
important? He's always doing that.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.720
Gotta go. Squash game
with Pete from the Treasury. Ooh(!)
Ooh(!) Pete from the Treasury?

03:11.720 --> 03:16.600
You probably heard.
He cut us some slack. I offered him
a game to smooth it over. Good luck.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.079
I've got
an appointment anyway. Cool.

03:19.079 --> 03:22.760
Bit of supper with the Prime
Minister, just the two of us.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.600
Should be fun.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.440
Oh, that's...very impressive.
No, it isn't, it's just what we do.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.880
It's normal.
..Well, enjoy that anyway. So...

03:31.880 --> 03:34.960
Can I phone you back -
GMTV, phone you later?

03:34.960 --> 03:38.600
See you, Dan. Well done. Good luck.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.600
Thank YOU.  Well done you, 

03:38.600 --> 03:41.880
well done everyone. Bye-bye!

03:38.600 --> 03:41.880
OK, bye-bye.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.079
I'm not complacent, Tom.

03:44.079 --> 03:47.920
Yeah, I know, we did take a hit
over the focus group thing.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.720
But it wasn't a BIG hit.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.800
Oh, yeah? Says who?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.840
Oh, the PM told you that, huh?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.720
Oh, get you(!) Look...

03:57.720 --> 04:01.840
I can only cook with what I've been
given. It's like Ready, Steady Cook,

04:01.840 --> 04:05.400
you give me Hugh Abbot,
I'll give you bangers and mash.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.000
But give me Jerry from the Home
Office, then I can raise it

04:09.000 --> 04:11.840
to a fuckin' risotto and scallops,
you know?

04:11.840 --> 04:14.240
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, OK, bye!

04:15.240 --> 04:21.160
Sam! Can you get me Terri Coverley
and Glenn Cullen?

04:21.160 --> 04:24.200
Make them an appointment
to come over.

04:24.200 --> 04:27.360
I think I've got to shout
at some people.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.280
Oh - actually...

04:29.280 --> 04:32.600
get me John at Culture on the phone.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.600
I'll have a shout now.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.240
Is this tie all right?

04:36.240 --> 04:40.280
It's fine. I don't want to come
across as some sort of... Sales rep.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.680
Do I look like a bloody sales rep?

04:42.680 --> 04:45.000
No, no, no... No. No. It's fine.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.720
What ARE those...?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.720
They're little hippos, aren't they?

04:49.720 --> 04:54.440
I don't know what they are, they're
just unidentified amusing creatures.

04:54.440 --> 04:58.920
Oh, I hate this! I've been called
in for a bollocking from Tucker

04:58.920 --> 05:02.720
just cos HE'S been twatted by the PM.
All he'll do is...

05:02.720 --> 05:06.800
spread it all over the office,
then we'll be off. Exactly.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.360
And we've every reason to be happy
bunnies. Day three of report stage

05:10.360 --> 05:14.320
and it's gone like a dream. Yeah.
A GOOD dream, not one of those

05:14.320 --> 05:16.920
where you can't move your legs.
Absolutely!

05:16.920 --> 05:21.920
Are you sure about this tie? It's
good, it's funny. Funny?! (Terri!)

05:21.920 --> 05:26.040
Fucking hell, this... No, it's not
funny. Political breakthrough night!

05:26.040 --> 05:31.080
I don't wanna get laughs off my
clothes! She didn't mean "funny
ha-ha". It's fine. No, leave it.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.440
Fuck, yes! Wish me luck.
I'm going without the tie.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.840
Right... I meant to ask,
did you stay in the flat last night?
For about a minute and a half.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.680
Kate rang.
Alicia had an ear infection.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.840
Obviously life and death(!)
Infected ear, huge crisis,

05:47.840 --> 05:51.640
hold the front-page Shuttle
disaster(!) I had to drive 20 miles

05:51.640 --> 05:55.480
through the night
to be ten feet from Alicia's ear

05:55.480 --> 05:57.240
which wasn't infected anyway. Oh.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.280
And Malcolm's been on at me
about the flat.

06:00.280 --> 06:06.320
He thinks there could be problems
with the Housing Bill. With you
having a flat in Notting Hill

06:06.320 --> 06:10.520
and living within commuting
distance? It IS empty quite a lot.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.120
The key-worker stuff in that bill...

06:13.120 --> 06:16.960
(But I NEED a place in London.
Everybody else important's got

06:16.960 --> 06:20.120
(a huge, fuck-off, grace-and-favour

06:16.960 --> 06:20.120
pad. Why haven't I got one?)

06:20.120 --> 06:24.960
I can sort this out if you leave it

06:20.120 --> 06:24.960
to me, do what we said, yes?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.800
The sale but not-a-sale.
Yeah, right, whatever.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.240
LOUDER: Right, I'll see you later.
We're off. OK.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.080
Enjoy supper.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.760
Enjoy your bollocking!

06:33.080 --> 06:35.760
HE LAUGHS 

06:35.760 --> 06:37.520
HE BLOWS

06:37.520 --> 06:39.240
God's sake, I'm not gonna kiss him.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.040
Good evening, Minister. Oh! Thank
you! If you'd like to step this way.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.480
Excuses, excuses!
Take your failure like a man, Ollie!

06:47.480 --> 06:50.080
OK, but next time -
and I want a rematch -

06:50.080 --> 06:52.720
Ah'm gonna take you DOWN, mu'fucker!

06:50.080 --> 06:52.720
Where are you from?

06:52.720 --> 06:56.720
I'm from Lincolnshire - the
windmills, the potatoes, the shit.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.880
Are they...? What, an item?

06:58.880 --> 07:03.000
Do you NEED me to suck up to you?
You're a politician...

07:03.000 --> 07:07.880
He made a pretty good just of

07:03.000 --> 07:07.880
shagging Angela Heaney. Could be bi.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.800
A lot of them are, you know. Oh.

07:09.800 --> 07:15.040
It's interesting seeing the dynamics
play within the...within the staff.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.680
There they are, look... Is he...?

07:17.680 --> 07:21.400
He's seen us. Has he seen you? Yes.
I'm...gonna go back into the office.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.880
I think the Minister's ducking.
He's actually ducked!

07:24.880 --> 07:30.520
So what time does this Daily Mail
hack get here? Ten minutes. It's
Angela Heaney, didn't I tell you?

07:30.520 --> 07:34.800
She left The Standard? Absolutely.
Go, on, ask me some questions. OK.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.440
I'll be Angela Heaney...
It's uncanny!

07:38.440 --> 07:42.600
Mind you, your tits are bigger.
Is it true that...

07:42.600 --> 07:46.640
although this Housing Bill went
through Parliament with ease...

07:46.640 --> 07:51.240
Actually, can you just do it as
yourself? It's a bit unsettling.

07:51.240 --> 07:56.560
Um... ..That you'd find a lot
of difficulty in the real world?

07:56.560 --> 08:00.600
On the contrary, this Bill will do
an extraordinary amount of good

08:00.600 --> 08:04.280
for an extraordinarily large number

08:00.600 --> 08:04.280
of people - ordinary people,

08:04.280 --> 08:08.560
but people who deserve a little bit
of the extraordinary in their lives.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.960
HE GIGGLES 

08:08.560 --> 08:10.960
Perfect! That's Brilliant!

08:10.960 --> 08:14.480
There you are, you see?
Ask me something HARD.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.440
Where's the Nazi gold,
you donkey-shagger?!

08:17.440 --> 08:20.800
I'm pleased you asked me that,
Angela, and let me just say

08:20.800 --> 08:25.000
this Bill will do an extraordinary
amount of good for an ex... Ah.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.200
Hello! Morning. You've showered off,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.200
have you? Showered off...?

08:29.200 --> 08:33.039
Yes, thanks, Clem, we've showered
off! You've been playing...?

08:33.039 --> 08:36.559
Early-morning game of squash, yeah.
I love it. fabulous game. You play?

08:36.559 --> 08:41.799
Ah, I used to, but not now.
I used to... At club level? ..Yeah.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.880
Were you on the ladder?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.680
N-No.

08:46.680 --> 08:51.160
Anyway, time for us to go
and meet Angela now.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.680
Yes. I hope SHE doesn't

08:51.160 --> 08:55.680
bounce me off the walls! ..Anyway...

08:55.680 --> 08:59.440
great to talk to you guys... Did you
know Angela was in the building?

08:59.440 --> 09:03.400
Er, yes. Will she be jealous(?)

09:03.400 --> 09:05.920
Hi, Tom, what can I do for you?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.480
..I DIDN'T know what he was doing
with his flat!

09:08.480 --> 09:10.520
I TOLD him that fucking flat w...

09:10.520 --> 09:13.080
Well, they're not running with this!

09:13.080 --> 09:17.160
Well, I know...he's got an interview

09:13.080 --> 09:17.160
now with that Angela Heaney,

09:17.160 --> 09:19.240
the twat bubble from The Standard...

09:20.720 --> 09:24.000
Fuck! She's just gone to The Mail.
I'm onto it!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.840
I wish you'd ask me more
about the Bill,

09:29.840 --> 09:31.920
it is an extraordinary triumph...

09:31.920 --> 09:34.280
I am asking you about the Bill. Good.

09:34.280 --> 09:39.720
Specifically about the empty-house
management orders.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.960
How do they square with the fact that
YOU ha second property lying empty

09:43.960 --> 09:47.160
that you won't sell?
It's not technically empty.

09:47.160 --> 09:52.200
I would've been staying there quite
recently, except my daughter was
very seriously ill. I've spoken...

09:52.200 --> 09:54.880
She's only seven.

09:54.880 --> 10:01.160
I've spoken to an Asian family who
say they've put in four separate
offers on your flat, all rejected

10:01.160 --> 10:04.480
with no explanation. Well, OK...

10:04.480 --> 10:06.320
OUT THE WAY!

10:06.320 --> 10:10.120
Is it because they're Asian?
No. G-God, no!

10:10.120 --> 10:13.280
Where the fuck is he?!
The goldfish bowl. Fuck!

10:13.280 --> 10:17.600
No, no. I'm very glad you brought
THAT up, because that gives me an...

10:17.600 --> 10:21.280
opportunity to... Sorry.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.600
Mucking about...
Um...I have always m-maintained...

10:28.600 --> 10:32.640
I am very sorry... Can I just borrow
the minister for a moment? Sure.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.040
Sorry. Be right back with you.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.160
VOICES INAUDIBLE

10:45.120 --> 10:47.040
..STUPID...!

10:48.320 --> 10:51.160
..know what the fuck is going on?!

10:51.160 --> 10:55.080
Angela... PRICK! ..can I get you
a fresh cup of, er, coffee or...?

10:55.080 --> 10:59.160
No, I'm fine.

10:55.080 --> 10:59.160
Would you like some tea? 

10:59.160 --> 11:02.240
No, no...

10:59.160 --> 11:02.240
No biscuits or anything? 

11:02.240 --> 11:05.080
..FUCKED...!
Do let me know if you need anything.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.200
Thanks.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.760
..GET in back in there...

11:06.200 --> 11:09.760
DOOR SHUTS NOISE OUT 

11:12.880 --> 11:14.920
Ah...

11:16.960 --> 11:21.040
Bit of a disagreement.
Blimey. Yes...

11:21.040 --> 11:25.200
Um, could you...? I'm just curious.
Could you hear...? Because...

11:25.200 --> 11:28.760
we were actually... We CAN be quite
brutal to each other,

11:28.760 --> 11:32.080
cos we're VERY good f-friends.
Right.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.040
Haven't been accepting ANY offers?
No. That wasn't the point!

11:36.040 --> 11:39.880
The whole deal was to put the flat
on the market so if the press asked,

11:39.880 --> 11:43.440
"Fuck off, he's selling it. Go away."
Then Hugh's got a place in town.

11:43.440 --> 11:48.040
Why the fuck is your
girlfriend hitting us with this?
She's not my girlfriend, Malcolm.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.440
You won't mind if I kill her, then,
will you? It'd solve a lot for me.

11:52.440 --> 11:58.040
Hey, hey, if you could sweet-talk
that sour-faced bitch into dropping
this, you... If I could sweet-talk

11:58.040 --> 12:01.600
that sour-faced bitch into anything,
I would've had a better four months.

12:01.600 --> 12:07.280
Just have to kill the BOTH of you,
then, eh?! Yeah, well!
That was a joke - a nasty one

12:07.280 --> 12:12.000
which masks many negative feelings
about this fuckin' department.
MOBILE RINGS

12:12.000 --> 12:17.400
Tom Davies. ..Tom! Hello! How a...?
Yes. No, he was already there.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.440
He was TALKING to her.

12:19.440 --> 12:24.600
W-What's happening? How was...?

12:19.440 --> 12:24.600
What is happening? That was supposed

12:19.440 --> 12:24.600
to be a NICE interview.

12:24.600 --> 12:29.280
What on earth did you say to her?
I-I think I denied being a racist.
God, I HOPE so.

12:29.280 --> 12:34.760
You didn't go, "I have lots of black
friends"? Of course not. I haven't.
I haven't ANY. What did you say?

12:34.760 --> 12:40.240
About the offers. I said I wasn't
aware, someone else was handling the
sale, I wasn't aware of any offers.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.720
Hugh. Hmm? Did you mention me
by name? Um...

12:44.720 --> 12:46.560
Possibly. No, I don't think...

12:46.560 --> 12:51.360
I-I may, in between denying racism,
possibly have...yes. Thank you.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.640
Thank you very much!
Thanks a fucking bunch!

12:55.640 --> 12:59.680
OK, so what's the line on this,
then? I-I... I d... I don't know!

12:59.680 --> 13:04.120
Why, what IS the line on this?
I don't know! Don't look at me!

13:04.120 --> 13:09.200
It's OK, we've got movement, we've
got a break! What? The flat's sold.

13:09.200 --> 13:16.120
What?! To the Asian family. For 40
grand below asking price. That's OK!
Jesus, what is happening?! Malcolm.

13:16.120 --> 13:21.880
What? We're too late. What?! All the
papers have got hold of it. What?!
The Express has been making offers -

13:21.880 --> 13:27.280
at the asking price and also for
£30,000 more. (Jesus!) Hasn't been
accepted. We've got to stall.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.000
This is madness. I just own a flat,
I haven't raped somebody.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.400
They call the scandal "Flatgate".
Scandal?! (Flatgate!) That's crap!

13:35.400 --> 13:39.560
Crap name for a scandal. They SHOULD
call it "Notting Hill Gate...gate."

13:39.560 --> 13:44.520
Can WE stop saying "scandal"?
You're joking. Are you joking now?

13:44.520 --> 13:48.640
On my way to stall them.
Yeah, GET stalling(!)

13:48.640 --> 13:51.440
Maybe we could
just blame it on Terri.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.480
That IS an option, isn't it?

13:55.480 --> 13:58.960
It's a FLAT. It is a SECOND HOME

13:58.960 --> 14:04.000
in a borough

13:58.960 --> 14:04.000
with thousands of homeless people -

13:58.960 --> 14:04.000
that you have kept empty for ages!

14:04.000 --> 14:07.960
Have you not read your own Housing
Bill(?) God! I only kept it empty

14:07.960 --> 14:11.000
for a little while
to see my bloody family.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.040
Obviously I should've filled it
with prostitutes and rent-boys

14:15.040 --> 14:19.600
and crack-cocaine pimp tattoo
freaks! Thanks to Dan Miller,

14:19.600 --> 14:23.640
the Housing Bill is a success. But
this is BURYING the whole thing.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.360
What d'you want me to do - resign(?)

14:26.360 --> 14:30.600
No, no! N... No, that is... I'm NOT
going, over this. The way out...

14:30.600 --> 14:34.720
This is madness! ..is for you to...
Malcolm, this desire for perfection

14:34.720 --> 14:38.280
is... But I am not perfect,
I am just a person, right?

14:38.280 --> 14:42.320
And I need to sleep, need to eat and
occasionally I need to take a dump!

14:42.320 --> 14:46.600
What's next? Do we put THAT on the
evening news, o-on the front page(?)

14:46.600 --> 14:52.800
"Minister In Disgusting Defecation
Outburst"! Mollie Sugden at No. 10 -
did you enjoy your shit, Mr Abbot?

14:52.800 --> 14:57.000
They should just clone ministers
so we're born at 55 with no past.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.560
And no flats and no genitals.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.320
Just a world of robots in a...
It's like a futuristic film.

15:03.320 --> 15:07.200
And YOU'D enjoy that. You'd be
in your little space station

15:07.200 --> 15:09.640
surrounded by...obedient androids

15:09.640 --> 15:14.280
like that fucking brushed-aluminium

15:09.640 --> 15:14.280
Dan Miller cyberprick!

15:14.280 --> 15:18.120
It IS possible to have
a good resignation, you know!

15:18.120 --> 15:22.840
A good resignation(?) I look forward
to how you're gonna sell THIS to me.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.640
Look, people really like it
when you go just a bit early.

15:26.640 --> 15:32.280
Steely-jawed, far-away look in your
eyes. Before they sit in the pub
going, "That fucker's got to go,"

15:32.280 --> 15:36.280
you SURPRISE them. "Blimey!
He's gone. I didn't expect that."

15:36.280 --> 15:41.600
"Resigned? You don't see that much
now." "Old school. Respect.
I rather liked the guy."

15:41.600 --> 15:45.640
"He was hounded out by the fucking
Press!" How about THAT, huh?

15:45.640 --> 15:48.240
What a way to go! Yeah?

15:48.240 --> 15:52.800
(It's probably gonna be... It's gonna
be Hugh that has to go this time.)

15:52.800 --> 15:55.640
Yeah.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.640
WHEEZY CACKLE

15:55.640 --> 15:57.760
SHE LAUGHS ALOUD

15:57.760 --> 16:02.080
..Yeah, no, it is, it's very sad.
Very sad.

16:02.080 --> 16:06.360
OK, Tom, yeah... Yes, indeed.
Two minutes, two minutes.

16:07.480 --> 16:12.120
Tom's finishing up with the Prime
Minister now. I'm gonna join them.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.960
Yup. You might as well stay here.
Yeah. Try and make it quick.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.560
You sure it wouldn't help if I sat
in with you? No. No, no...

16:19.560 --> 16:23.320
Well, we'll be talking about you.
Yeah. It'd be awkward, wouldn't it?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.720
Of course. Very. You just...relax.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.400
Help yourself to a paper
or something.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.720
It'll be fine in the end. I mean...

16:31.720 --> 16:35.760
(We'll just get another doomed,
middle-aged man in on Monday morning

16:35.760 --> 16:37.800
(who'll come through the door,

16:37.800 --> 16:39.840
(stride about a bit, spunk off...

16:39.840 --> 16:42.640
(and I'll mop up the mess -
business as usual.)

17:08.440 --> 17:12.520
The whole heat could come out
of this situation if I went.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.560
It's not come to any resignation
yet, surely?

17:15.560 --> 17:19.400
D'you know what pisses me off?
After 37 years,

17:19.400 --> 17:23.680
without a moment's thought, he's
prepared to drop me right in it.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.720
He's just panicking. No, if anyone's
gonna resign, I should go. No, no.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.360
Decent of you, but I'LL go.
You should stay.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.400
Any fucker can sit
behind a pot-plant,

17:33.400 --> 17:37.440
but YOU'RE the man who stands behind
his desk making sure the pen works.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.640
Right. So maybe you SHOULD go.

17:39.640 --> 17:43.640
Now, hang on! You've convinced me.
I think it would be better.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.360
No, I'm just SAYING - in the scheme
of things - not saying I should GO.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.320
I thought you just said you should
go. No, I'm talking... You said!

17:51.320 --> 17:55.200
..academically. That wasn't
academic. Absolutely WAS. It wasn't!

17:55.200 --> 17:57.760
I... Not academic talk,
that was TALKING talk.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.840
Well, I'M having an academic
discussion. Not with ME.

18:00.840 --> 18:05.880
I'm having a REAL discussion with
you. Well, we can re-set for a real
discussion. Resign here and now,

18:05.880 --> 18:10.120
and I'll put the letter on Hugh's
desk. I can very easily say the same!

18:10.120 --> 18:14.080
I'M not doing that. Why the fuck not?
Hugh's my friend, I'M not doing it.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.920
I'll stay and stand behind him! I'm
just a counter-man at McDonalds,

18:17.920 --> 18:23.440
I'm that important. YOU'RE the clown

18:17.920 --> 18:23.440
running the shop, the one they want

18:17.920 --> 18:23.440
to see strung from a lamppost

18:23.440 --> 18:25.160
by his fucking wig.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.080
What does THAT make me?
Ronald McDonald.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.920
Well, fuck off!

18:29.920 --> 18:32.320
I'm not going, mate. Neither am I.

18:32.320 --> 18:38.480
So, um, what did the PM say?
There'll be an inquiry.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.920
LOUD GASP

18:40.920 --> 18:43.080
Oh, yes! Oh-h...!

18:43.080 --> 18:45.640
Thank you! You're a fucking star.
That's OK.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.480
Sam... Yeah, of course.
..Hugh, Hugh.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.880
Yes? Prime Minister. Could you...?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.200
(Whoo!)

19:05.800 --> 19:08.320
BISCUITS CRUNCH

19:05.800 --> 19:08.320
Mmm! Hello.

19:08.320 --> 19:12.120
Oh! Hello. Is everything
all right, Minister? Mmm.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.240
Those weren't special biscuits,
were they? No. No, no. Good.

19:16.240 --> 19:22.640
How are you? I have been better, to
be honest, but there's gonna be an
inquiry, so. Right. Fingers crossed.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.000
Well, we're all rooting for you.
Aw! Thank you very much.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.160
Can I get you a chair?
Would you like to sit down?

19:31.160 --> 19:34.440
Yes. Please.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.760
You have the biscuits. Thank you.

19:51.760 --> 19:57.880
Um, can I get you more biscuits?
Some coffee? Yes, please.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.000
< SOFT MURMURS

20:02.000 --> 20:03.960
Ollie Reeder.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.560
What? 'Put me on the speakerphone.'
It's the minister. Oh. '..Inquiry.'

20:08.560 --> 20:12.600
Can you speak up? Where are you?
I'm still at No. 10.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.680
They'll have an inquiry.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.840
YES! Great!

20:15.840 --> 20:18.880
Who are they gonna have?
I don't know.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.160
I don't know whether we get any say
in it. But Lord Hibbert's very nice.

20:23.160 --> 20:27.200
I was with him at the FA Cup
semi-final last year,

20:27.200 --> 20:30.320
and we both tried to make out
we had a clue what was going on.

20:30.320 --> 20:34.760
We've had this conversation before -
the ideal person for an inquiry.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.680
It was a dead heat between
Eamon Holmes and Alan Bennett.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.040
Tell you who'd be good -
Lord Monkton. Lord Monkton?

20:42.040 --> 20:46.560
LOUDLY

20:42.040 --> 20:46.560
Lord Monkton certainly is

20:42.040 --> 20:46.560
in the frame here at No. 10. Uh-huh?

20:46.560 --> 20:48.680
Yeah, I'm with the PM's people now.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.320
Hugh. Oh!
..Malcolm's just joined us.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.360
Right, Hugh, um...the good news.

20:54.360 --> 20:59.840
The PM's gonna approach the Right

20:54.360 --> 20:59.840
Honourable Lord Monkton of Cheshunt

20:54.360 --> 20:59.840
to head the inquiry. Good.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.040
It IS Monkton. 'YES!'

21:02.040 --> 21:05.040
OK, fuck off,
you've a department to run.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.480
Thanks. Thanks, Malcolm. Yeah, yeah.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.480
Thanks...

21:08.480 --> 21:12.520
Seen this one? "PM Just Can't Kick
The Abbot". Dreadful picture.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.120
You look like a sales rep.
They're Photoshop.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.760
Surprised they haven't anything
better to write about after,

21:19.760 --> 21:21.720
what is it, five days now?

21:21.720 --> 21:24.720
They'll stay on this.
They want blood.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.080
MOBILE RINGS
Oh, hang on. ..Good morning, Malcolm.

21:28.080 --> 21:32.040
I want you, Terri and Ollie
over here right now. Not Hugh.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.120
Do not bring Hugh to Downing Street.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.240
'Put him on.' Yes, OK, hang on.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.280
It's Malcolm.
He wants to speak to you. ..Go on.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.920
Hugh, I've seen Monkton's report.
It's not good. OK.

21:43.920 --> 21:49.480
He's talked to that driver you got
rid of. Oh, God! I never liked him.
I told Glenn I didn't like him.

21:49.480 --> 21:54.280
The driver. He was a smirky bastard.
He's told him he heard you and Glenn

21:54.280 --> 21:58.360
talk about putting your flat on
the market but not accepting offers.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.240
In passing! Mentioned in passing,
j-just as WORDS, you know.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.280
It's not as if we were plotting
like Guy Fawkes,

22:05.280 --> 22:09.400
concocting our evil master-plan to
not sell a two-bedroomed flat(!)

22:09.400 --> 22:14.160
I didn't know Glenn had
gone ahead. I'm just tired. Is that
a crime now? Feeling shattered?

22:14.160 --> 22:18.800
You feeling shattered will not be
the headline. It'll be YOU'VE LIED.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.520
Right, look, I want your guys over
here, but not you. Understand?

22:23.520 --> 22:29.200
Sure it wouldn't be helpful? Or are
you ALL gonna be talking about me?
We'll ALL be talking about you.

22:30.320 --> 22:36.280
Right, I'll...ring for a cab,
it's quicker than calling
one of the cars up. OK? OK.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.840
Right, well...let's get going.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.840
Yup. 

22:38.840 --> 22:41.120
Ah, Hugh. Yup. Bye. Yup.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.520
Yup. See you later... OK.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.560
..probably, anyway.

22:49.960 --> 22:54.240
Hugh. I mean, with the other two,
it's just another day, eh? I know.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.680
I want you to know I'm on your side. 

22:56.680 --> 22:58.280
You know?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.200
I wouldn't...

23:00.200 --> 23:02.320
We'll ride again.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.520
Department of Social Affairs(?)

23:16.520 --> 23:21.120
Department of fucking shocking,
shitty, charlatan SHIT! That's...

23:21.120 --> 23:25.400
Feet off the furniture, you Oxbridge
twat! You're no' on a punt now.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.680
Yes, I am king of remembering
my own password.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.720
KNOCK AT DOOR

23:35.680 --> 23:37.720
Yeah!

23:37.720 --> 23:42.280
Oh, Dan! Hi, Hugh. Is Ollie about?
No, he's with Tucker. They all are.

23:42.280 --> 23:46.200
Something up? No, no,
they're just talking about...

23:46.200 --> 23:51.240
a directive from some think-tank
thinks press secretaries

23:51.240 --> 23:56.480
should minute their meetings with
lobbyists... Right. So they're...

23:56.480 --> 23:58.640
just talking about how fucked I am.

23:58.640 --> 24:03.000
Oh, the report? Yeah. Like Monkton
sat in front of the word-processor

24:03.000 --> 24:07.640
and let the righteous anger
of the independent judiciary
flow through him.

24:07.640 --> 24:12.880
It's such a something-and-nothing
issue to get crucified over.
Just a flat! Precisely.

24:12.880 --> 24:18.280
Just cos I'm not
some brushed-aluminium,
you know...cyberprick. Like...

24:18.280 --> 24:20.480
Er, like... Like Ollie.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.400
..Yeah. Mm. Anyway,

24:22.400 --> 24:25.680
I've missed my ideal
resigning-point. Yes.

24:25.680 --> 24:30.320
With every day I delay, it's another
year before I can get back again.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.520
Mmm. If I'd resigned
the day I was appointed,

24:33.520 --> 24:36.520
I'd actually be Prime Minister
by now.

24:36.520 --> 24:41.360
The line is we don't throw
a good man to the wolves
over one little fuck-up.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.840
So Hugh's staying? Yeah.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.120
Tell the wolves to fuck off.
Not exactly.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.960
They need a blood sacrifice. Indeed.
They want a head on a plate.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.360
We've gotta give 'em a head,
you're saying?

24:56.120 --> 24:59.440
You're clever, aren't you?
Very, very clever.

24:59.440 --> 25:03.280
How much does your head weigh? 8lb?

25:03.280 --> 25:05.080
Maybe more.

25:06.360 --> 25:10.440
Mmm. It's not MY head - I've only
got half a head! I'm a half-head.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.800
One of you has got to decide. Which
of you are gonna do the decent thing?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.280
We've been through this! Apparently,
I'm Ronald fucking McDonald(!)

25:18.280 --> 25:21.640
Hang on! Why are YOU not included?
Why one of us two?

25:21.640 --> 25:25.800
Well, if I'VE got to resign, then
you've got to resign. "If I'VE..."

25:25.800 --> 25:29.840
I've got to listen to you on matters
of policy. So HE'S gotta go, then,

25:29.840 --> 25:34.280
cos I answer to him.

25:29.840 --> 25:34.280
We've ALL got to go now, eh(?) 

25:29.840 --> 25:34.280
I'm going nowhere.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.680
I didn't DO anything. Nothing.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.680
Oh, Terri! 

25:36.680 --> 25:40.720
Grow up! Don't give me
that pile of fucking bollocks!

25:40.720 --> 25:44.760
Just because you're a civil servant,
don't think your shit doesn't smell!

25:44.760 --> 25:47.960
I know things about you.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.960
..What? What d'you know?

25:47.960 --> 25:52.160
Yeah, we know things. Oh, knob off!
You know bugger-all! All you know

25:52.160 --> 25:57.840
is how to suck up to the new kid
on the block. "Ooh, what a lovely
backhand! Ooh, my stroke's so HARD."

25:57.840 --> 26:02.000
You're so fucking repressed...
I was just playing squash!

26:02.000 --> 26:06.160
Glenn, what d'you know? What is it?

26:02.000 --> 26:06.160
What is it you think y...? 

26:02.000 --> 26:06.160
I KNOW. 

26:06.160 --> 26:08.360
What is it?

26:06.160 --> 26:08.360
I'm gonna see Tucker and resign. 

26:08.360 --> 26:10.360
YOU don't need to resign. I know.

26:10.360 --> 26:14.480
Well DON'T, Hugh! No, I've been
thinking. It'll be VERY good.

26:14.480 --> 26:19.600
The report isn't out for three days.
I can leave before it with dignity.

26:19.600 --> 26:23.600
I'll be seen as an honourable man,
be back in government in two years

26:23.600 --> 26:25.480
with a clean slate and a fresh tie.

26:25.480 --> 26:31.040
And I'll be shot of this fucking
department. Takes four days to get
a memo through! "Social Affairs."

26:31.040 --> 26:33.360
What the fuck does it actually MEAN?

26:33.360 --> 26:37.400
It's so vague. "Hello, I'm
Hugh Abbot, the Minister for...

26:37.400 --> 26:41.240
"I dunno - stuff." And take a look
at these civil servants here.

26:41.240 --> 26:46.240
You wouldn't get these dweebs
at the Foreign Office. This place
is packed to the gills with dreck.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.880
No offence.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.920
..Well, I accept it. On behalf of
the PM, I accept your resignation.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.680
As you've worked out,
it's probably for the best.

26:56.680 --> 27:01.760
Minister, hello. Just going to
see Mr Tucker. Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr Tucker has someone there.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.480
I won't be a second. Quite urgent.
Sorry, you're have to wait. Right.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.960
Get you a biscuit?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.720
Thank you.

27:12.720 --> 27:16.760
You won't regret this, Dan.
Trust me, you won't. No...

27:16.760 --> 27:18.480
let's hope not.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.720
Ah, you must be gutted.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.080
Yeah. Yeah, yeah...

27:26.280 --> 27:28.000
Hi. Dan.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.120
Oh, you're seeing Malcolm? Yeah.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.080
Thank you.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.440
Malcolm, I've made a decision.

27:38.040 --> 27:41.880
..You know, what I said about memos

27:38.040 --> 27:41.880
in the department, - I mean,

27:41.880 --> 27:45.920
that's sortable. Cos we can just...
well, sort it. Just an admin thing.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.160
Don't worry, no-one's taken...
We know what you mean. Yeah.

27:49.160 --> 27:55.720
Lovely memo on urban renewal. Oh,
good. See, here's a memo and it's
only taken me a day to get to me.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.760
So things are looking up already.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.440
Dan really did himself some favours
there, you know. Maybe you're right.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.440
Would you like to hear what
our leader thinks? The PM's reply

28:05.440 --> 28:09.480
to his resignation letter. "You are
a dazzlingly bright, talented,

28:09.480 --> 28:14.640
"committed and honourable
new force in British politics.
I'm immensely sorry to lose you

28:14.640 --> 28:20.000
"but I predict you will
one day find yourself in
very high office indeed."

28:20.000 --> 28:24.240
Well...that's easy. The resigning's
just... That's just cheap and lazy.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.080
Yeah.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.080
Little shit, anyway, Dan Miller. 

28:27.080 --> 28:31.320
I never liked him.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.320
I never liked him. I never

28:27.080 --> 28:31.320
ever, ever liked him.

28:31.320 --> 28:35.840
Look, it's really late. Let's....
Come on, Glenn. Time to go home.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.960
OK. I thought Dan was good.

28:37.960 --> 28:42.080
See you. Goodnight.

28:37.960 --> 28:42.080
Goodnight, Hugh. 

28:44.840 --> 28:46.880
HE SIGHS

28:48.280 --> 28:51.560
Actually, can I stay
on your sofa tonight?

28:53.880 --> 28:55.920
Yeah. Thanks.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.960
Take your time.
I'll... I'll wait for you, then.
