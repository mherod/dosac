1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.160
This programme contains very strong language

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.760
As we enter the third week,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.320
I find Mr Tickle's attention-seeking, tent-based twattery

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.280
even more annoying than in weeks one and two.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.320
We haven't made him, we just sold his house.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.680
What do you put into the Networked Nation? Well...

7
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.240
I am...a minister.

8
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.920
Look at this, no missed calls.

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.160
I used to have missed calls piling up like fucking pizza leaflets.

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.880
I suppose it means everything's fine. How was your evening?

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.920
Really nice.

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.240
We managed to get a table at Mishkin's. Oh.

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.560
And you? Ah, a bit of a quiet one.

14
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.360
Just a bottle of pinot and Twitter-abusing the cast of Glee.

15
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.160
Was kind of wonderful in its own way.

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.800
Malcolm, can I have a couple of words?

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.920
Political lightweight? Making up the numbers?

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
Sorry, that's four, isn't it? Lovely, lovely, yeah, you still got it(!)

19
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040
But, erm, seriously, can I just, er...

20
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.040
'Don't take too wide a step.' 'Start with the right.'

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.600
'Yes. OK, so relax.'

22
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.840
Cenotaph, here.

23
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.880
Right. OK? Off you go.

24
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.880
Yeah, I think that's TOO slow.

25
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.200
A minute ago you said I was too fast.

26
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.440
You look like Sleeping Beauty, that's just weird.

27
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.040
You look like you've been dug up. OK.

28
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.640
Do you remember when you got married?

29
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.280
I'd rather fucking not. OK, Nicola...

30
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.960
Olly, shit! I had it then.

31
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.360
Right, sorry to interrupt you at this very SAD time,

32
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.640
er, but we do have Prime Minister's Questions in one hour.

33
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.600
No, it's fine, I've got the lead question,

34
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.680
I've got the follow up sarcastic question

35
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.760
and I've got the withering put down, so I'm prepped, I'm fucking prepped.

36
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.680
Yep, you'll walk rings round him(!)

37
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.280
Erm, this does seem to be taking an awfully long time.

38
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.880
Is that too bouncy? What do you mean "bouncy"?

39
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.680
Cos that's helping with my balance but if it looks... Bouncy?!

40
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.400
It is too bouncy. Well, that's... You've over exaggerated now.

41
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.760
It's like you've got rickets.

42
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.320
Its Remembrance Sunday. THAT'S what your face should be doing - remembering.

43
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560
Think of a sad thing and rememb... Not remembering!

44
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.160
You don't want to be going along going, "Oh, that reminds..."

45
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Is that what you do when you're remembering?

46
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.880
I think I've got it, I've got it. Right, let's see. Look, watch.

47
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.200
I'm starting with my left foot but never mind that.

48
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.440
Now my shoe's coming off.

49
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.840
The leader of the opposition is in that room, Malcolm,

50
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.880
practising walking.

51
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.320
I mean, baby horses can walk from the womb.

52
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.200
She's one-nil down to a pony!

53
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.000
A pony isn't a baby horse, it's a foal, a fucking foal is a baby horse.

54
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.960
Right, our guest tonight on I Don't Give A Fuck About Baby Horses is me.

55
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600
We need to do something about Nicola.

56
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200
I mean, you know about her plan? I mean, Nicola with a plan?!

57
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.080
That's like a...toddler with a harpoon.

58
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.880
There's a toddler wandering around in that office with a harpoon.

59
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.560
Yes, well, don't you worry about Nicola's plan -

60
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.040
I'll deal with that Sweaty Betty.

61
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.560
Listen, when you wake up in the morning, you've got a routine, haven't you?

62
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.320
Big shit, granola, check the e-mail, shower and a shave, Nespresso...

63
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.760
sometimes a second shit.

64
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.720
Exactly, you have a plan, that's good.

65
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.280
Nicola has a plan, that's not good -

66
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.240
but I have a plan that's fucking great.

67
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.720
And then I bow?

68
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.400
It's more of a nod, anyway.

69
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.880
Yeah, it's, sort of, "All right, dead-oes?", but a bit more solemn.

70
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.840
Remember to put the wreath down this time.

71
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.200
I didn't actually not put it...

72
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.760
It got caught in my glove, I told you.

73
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000
Oh, that's very moving, "They shall not grow old,

74
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.440
"who photocopy their arses at the Christmas do."

75
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.520
Look, I don't want to show myself up

76
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.680
in front of 5,000 uniformed pensioners again.

77
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800
I'm glad you're thinking about those pensioners

78
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.080
cos those are the poor fuckers who gave everything

79
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.840
so people like you could play at running the country. Oh nice.

80
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.280
Olly, walk with me.

81
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.720
Er, forwards or backwards?

82
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.600
Malcolm!

83
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600
You'd get a much better response from her if you didn't bully her.

84
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.600
Sweetheart, she should be doing the bullying.

85
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.920
She should be taking the PM's lunch money and using his arse as a fruit machine,

86
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.080
not practising throwing a straw frisbee in slow motion!

87
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.760
I don't think you got enough cuddles as a child.

88
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.960
So how do we engage with this demographic?

89
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.960
The first thing is, is first of all, knowing who we're talking about,

90
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.320
then finding a name for them.

91
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.640
People who would do something for nothing.

92
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.320
They are mugs. Mugs do something for nothing.

93
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.240
Erm, how about, "deserving work force"?

94
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.040
OLLY SNORTS

95
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.520
Why are you laughing, does it sound a bit Pravda-ish?

96
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.200
What, handbags?

97
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.320
Pravda! Soviet newspaper.

98
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.960
This is the sort of person, they find an umbrella on a bus,

99
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.200
they go all the way to the depot just to give it back.

100
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.880
They're commuters, they are the street pounders,

101
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.160
street walkers, er...

102
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.440
You can't call them "street walkers"!

103
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.640
They're the people who deal with the little stuff, erm...

104
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.680
Wombles. Honest Wombles. Everyday Wombles...?

105
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.400
Sorry, I've just got to take a call. Erm, straights?

106
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.960
No. No? No, of course, sorry.

107
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.200
Commuting Champions?

108
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.560
Inter-rail... Human inter-railers...

109
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.040
"Human inter-railers"? That's inter-railers.

110
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.520
Er, everyday superstars...

111
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.360
All-British supremes...

112
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.560
Fuck, that sounds like a racist tribute band.

113
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.840
Ordinary people with, with something special about them,

114
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.040
with a special power. Please, don't say "special".

115
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.840
Don't say special. No, but, you know, like, people as superheroes.

116
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.120
Iron people, spider people... They're just regular citizens

117
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.400
but they have this, that one special quality

118
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.680
that makes them like Batman or Batpeople. Erm, the quiet...

119
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.040
Batpeople.

120
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.880
Quiet Batpeople?

121
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.640
No, that's not it.

122
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.240
That's the general area we're looking at, is what I'm saying.

123
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.280
It's just a marker.

124
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.760
Yep, shall we wrap it up and make a move? Shad Cab?

125
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.480
Yes. Don't, don't say "Shad Cab".

126
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.960
Don't... Why not? Cos it's Shadow Cabinet, isn't it?

127
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.520
It's like saying spag bol.

128
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.400
Fuck annoy!

129
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.320
All very worthwhile. What a session. "Quiet Batpeople"?

130
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.920
What's she doing, is she fucking sniffing the pens at night?

131
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.960
This is every day.

132
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.360
This is what we do every day, scat all day.

133
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.280
Jizz FM! Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah!

134
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.840
What's going on in that abandoned barn of a brain of hers?

135
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.280
This is, this can't go on - this is fucking suicide.

136
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.040
Malcolm, I know, I know, I know.

137
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.080
I mean, Nicola...

138
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.360
she's a nice lady - especially when she's drunk. Yes!

139
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.360
Karaoke, you can't take her karaoke off her. Fucking wish I could!

140
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.080
She's going to have to fall on her sword.

141
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.360
Which means that we have to stick one in the ground, trip her onto it,

142
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.840
get someone to jump up and down on her back for ten minutes!

143
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.000
Nothing personal. Nothing personal, of course not! Of course not.

144
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.520
So, Ben tells me you have a plan.

145
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.840
Anything I should be worrying about?

146
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.240
You're not going to found a religion, are you?

147
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.080
Reshuffle? Don't send Ben to the backbench

148
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.680
cos he'll just wank and eat Pringles.

149
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.000
Leather seats are an invitation to him. Morning.

150
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.920
You'll never get in. Ha-ha!

151
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.240
Cock!

152
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.440
New party logo - a kitten.

153
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.360
A kitten in a sock. Kitten in a sock, sitting on a motorway, shouting,

154
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.520
"Help me, I don't know what to do!" Getting close?

155
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.840
All right, look, I just think we need to show,

156
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.360
we need to be seen to accept

157
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.240
that there are tough decisions to be made.

158
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.360
So, I thought it would be a good idea if we publicly agreed

159
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.800
with two government policies that we previously opposed.

160
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.920
That's all.

161
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.640
Can we talk about this? Yes absolutely, Malcolm.

162
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.480
We'll, we'll talk about this in Cabinet, OK?

163
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.320
I'll be talking, you'll be nodding.

164
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.640
I'm struggling here, you want us to agree with the government?

165
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.000
Not on everything, obviously.

166
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.600
No, we're just going to back two government policies -

167
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.240
the coastguard pay freeze

168
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.360
and the end of ring-fenced funding for primary school breakfast clubs.

169
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.400
So, what?

170
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.000
We're now in favour of drowning sailors and starving children?

171
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.560
We are, technically, the opposition. Can I be devil's advocate here for a moment?

172
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.800
Nicola's right, of course, she's right,

173
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.440
but we should at least think about what Dan has to say here

174
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.240
because we've already seen one set of quisling wankers cross the floor and join JB's barmy army.

175
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.680
If the opposition now join them

176
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.320
everyone will just be facing half an empty fucking chamber.

177
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.720
Yeah, it's important that we rise above partisan politics, Dan...

178
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.960
so that, Dan, so that we can take our poll ratings with us.

179
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.120
Malcolm? Malcolm...

180
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.160
Sorry.

181
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.400
Could you not, talk behind my back? Thank you. Sorry.

182
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.520
Now, you know, if you don't think that message is clear,

183
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.800
then that's fine but it is your job to clarify it.

184
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.320
Fine. Good. OK, great.

185
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.920
Before we finish,

186
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.400
I just want to throw one more pebble into the thought pool.

187
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.160
Ploop. Sorry, Ben, I missed that.

188
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.680
Just, sorry, I said "ploop".

189
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.240
It's just the noise of a pebble being dropped.

190
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.880
Er, we're still having a bit of trouble

191
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.600
connecting with the, the ordinary voter.

192
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.760
The, erm, the silent majority.

193
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.920
Erm, Malcolm, can you talk us through our session this morning?

194
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.800
Well, for the record, I do think that this is a good idea.

195
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.400
Do you mind if I...? Helen, can I borrow your notes a second...

196
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.800
Oh, I should say, actually, none of this is set in stone.

197
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.400
You know, they're, they're not even set in Plasticine!

198
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.080
So, the marker for this target demographic is Quiet Batpeople.

199
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.120
As I say... "Quiet Batpeople"?!

200
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.680
Quiet Batpeople, it's everyday superheroes.

201
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.920
There's a big tick next to that here. Everyday heroes like...

202
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.200
like vigilantes?

203
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.000
It's ordinary people, not vigilantes.

204
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.200
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.

205
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.360
"Little" being the operative word, "pretty" not.

206
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.640
Helen's written here, "Normality as a kind of superpower."

207
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.640
OK, I'm sensing, er, opposition.

208
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.160
Good, cos earlier you were talking about getting rid of that(?)

209
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.160
SOME PEOPLE LAUGH

210
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.720
So, I would like everybody to take the idea away

211
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.120
and just let it percolate.

212
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.840
OK, good, er...

213
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.920
Oh, poppies!

214
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.880
Last thing, can we just make ABSOLUTELY sure

215
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.440
we have them on at all times.

216
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.880
Jackets, coats...

217
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.080
Or batsuits.

218
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.400
SOME PEOPLE LAUGH

219
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.440
Wear your poppies or you will be shot at dawn!

220
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.520
NICOLA LAUGHS

221
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.560
(Thank you.)

222
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.080
Yes, thank you(!)

223
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.520
Well, I had more fun at my last mammogram!

224
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.880
Oh, no, you were fine.

225
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.600
Well, maybe... You fox-faced fuck!

226
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.160
Dan The-demi-man Miller, interview with The New Statesman -

227
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.280
he says that he, "pledges himself to change the fractured and shaky narrative at the heart of the party."

228
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.840
Arse! Well, I'm pledging myself to find Dan Mr Smoothie Miller

229
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.640
and fracture and shake him into an actual fucking smoothie.

230
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.360
Looks like a fun runner's lost his way.

231
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.360
Why are there bits of food wandering about?

232
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.520
Are you for the chop? It's a fucking hack pack.

233
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.800
Any comment on Dan Miller's article? No comment, be gracious, smile, look good. No questions.

234
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.040
Are you for the chop, Mrs Murray? Oh, it's a chop!

235
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.880
Oh, it's that dick from The Mirror who... Are you top of the chops?

236
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.480
Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Thank you.

237
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.000
You, fuck off! Get back to the fucking Flintstones.

238
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.840
Turn up like that again I'll fucking stick that down your throat

239
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.440
and pull it out your arse.

240
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.520
That's enough. I don't even do things I enjoy for that long! That's it!

241
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.280
No questions, Nicola's got a government to bring down.

242
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.600
No comment, no comment, thanks very much.

243
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.640
Why did we have to stand there smiling like that?

244
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.000
You think it'd be better if you were seen in tears?

245
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.320
I just think my face next to a chop does not look good

246
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.320
unless I'm applying for a job in ASDA!

247
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.360
Why pictures of her coming from Shadow Cabinet?

248
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.040
Maybe they don't want pictures of her, maybe they want you.

249
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.680
Maybe they want pictures of an over-botoxed Nancy Dell'Olio?

250
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.360
Right, the first chance you get just go and deal with Dan.

251
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.320
Tear him a new bum or whatever it is people say.

252
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.720
Right, right, right, right, right.

253
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.000
I mean, what would possess you to walk about the streets

254
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.400
with notes just...there for anybody to see?

255
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.920
They're my notes but they're your shit suggestions.

256
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.280
Well, I'm not the one flapping them about in such a way

257
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.760
that the press can take pictures of them! How was I to know?

258
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.440
They were taking a photo of Nicola... Cos you're an adult...

259
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.800
"Quite Batpeople" on EVERY fucking paper!

260
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.560
Right, this is a wake-up call.

261
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.760
By the way, the next time you want to make Nicola look like a clown,

262
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.440
with her fucking hair on fire,

263
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.240
why don't you just take your notes down to Snappy Snaps

264
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.200
and get them blown up to gigantic cheque size

265
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.520
so the partially sighted can be in on the fucking gag?!

266
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.840
I didn't know they'd be able to see it!

267
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.760
So we have to seize the agenda,

268
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.920
we have to deflect attention away from all this.

269
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.440
It's now time to embrace our friend Mr Tickle.

270
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.040
I can't say his name without smiling.

271
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.480
Well, he's not smiling, is he?

272
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.160
He's living in a tent cos his key worker housing was sold off.

273
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.120
Yes and he's a 24 carat fucking nutcase.

274
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.840
Which means that Peter Mannion

275
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840
has been picking on a man with a history of depression.

276
00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.040
That's a way right into the principality of pricks, right there.

277
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.520
Yeah, and that's EXACTLY what they will expect me to do.

278
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.840
They'll know about his mental health records as well.

279
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.880
They'll just be waiting for me to attack and I'm not going to and THAT will surprise them.

280
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.560
I think that you and I need to have a little talk.

281
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.240
A proper talk.

282
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.560
Like when mummy explains why daddy's going to be in the papers tomorrow.

283
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.640
Out. You mean you'd like us to go?

284
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.600
Yes, into exile, preferably. Bhutan's nice.

285
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.000
I need to know that you're really on top of things, actually, Malcolm.

286
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.040
I do my fucking job!

287
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.880
Well, do you do your fucking job out of a sense of obligation

288
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.280
or are you doing it because you actually believe in me?

289
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.840
Oh, let me boomer-fucking-rang that one right back at you, do you believe in you?

290
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.360
Cos I can't see any fucking fire in your eyes.

291
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.680
I can't even see the clicking of the, of the pilot light

292
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.600
to try and get a tiny, little flame going.

293
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.640
What I do see is that you might at any day decide,

294
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.080
"Oh, I've fucking had enough," and go off and get a blanket from the car.

295
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.120
I slightly resent what you're saying.

296
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.080
The fact of the matter is, I do not believe in my heart of hearts...

297
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.000
that you're hungry for power.

298
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.080
You've got no idea how hungry for power I am.

299
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.320
You have to really fucking want to do this. This is what I'm telling you!

300
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.800
I FUCKING want this... Shit, people can hear me.

301
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.640
I am hungry for this, yes!

302
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.640
Well, you've got to be as hungry as a fucking Hutu

303
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.000
in the fucking jungle with a big machete.

304
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.920
You've got to go HACKING through the fucking opposition

305
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.880
with a big fucking belt full of hands and a necklace made of ears.

306
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.920
Can you do that?

307
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.920
Yes. Can you wear a necklace made of ears?

308
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.960
I can be a Hutu -

309
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.160
I can wear fucking fingernail bracelets, I can...

310
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.200
do this, Malcolm, yes.

311
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.680
THAT'S what we need to see.

312
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.080
Yeah, I promise you, I can deliver.

313
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.880
I can see that.

314
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.680
She's got Bette Davis eyes.

315
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.440
You're going to do this. Brilliant, thank you, Malcolm.

316
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.520
Fucking useless.

317
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.480
She is unstoppable and she loves you.

318
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.760
Because a wine tasting is not a night out, it's an admission of defeat.

319
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.200
You might as well go to...

320
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.880
Er, Jo, I'll call you back

321
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.320
Hiya, I thought you were bollocking Dan Miller?

322
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.400
Oh, I am.

323
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.840
Right, is he...?

324
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.040
I'm in the middle of slamming his smug face

325
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.320
into a verbal deep fat fryer.

326
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.160
You know Dan, of course, don't you? Why don't you sit down and join us?

327
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
Er... Join us!

328
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.240
I don't know if you've met Mrs Susan Doherty?

329
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.200
Mrs Doherty is a quiet fucking batperson, or a fucking motorway mingebag,

330
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.040
or whatever the fuck we're calling these fickle shits this week.

331
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.200
I'm going to get a coffee, do you want anything?

332
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.200
I'll have a fucking Fanta. OK.

333
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.080
You know what I think I did wrong last year?

334
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.040
I think I set off on the wrong foot

335
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.640
because I actually have a bit of a problem with left and right.

336
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.320
It's like directional dyslexia or dyspedia, dys...

337
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.320
PHONE BEEPS

338
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.800
It's one of the dys... Oh, I'm doing it now.

339
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.520
For goodness sake. Oh, is this more quiet bat guano?

340
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.240
This Week would like to photograph politicians

341
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.960
wearing underpants over their clothes.

342
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.560
And Grazia would like to know

343
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.200
what you carry in your utility belt and why?

344
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.080
I'll say you're not interested. I'm fucking not interested.

345
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.640
I'm only interested in working out which of my feet is which.

346
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.840
So we need to be rid of Nicola.

347
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.680
Rid of her? She's tank.

348
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.720
She's fucking electoral asbestos. Wow, so...you, you want to...?

349
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.440
I want this party back in power where we can help people.

350
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.560
I don't know whether you've noticed but we haven't got any fucking power.

351
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.840
We can't help anyone. We're like a family in a Cuban slum.

352
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.680
We're out in the middle of nowhere. We're in the fucking...middle of the ocean,

353
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.560
with our own Ellen MacArthur sobbing, crying - enough.

354
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.160
Over the side she goes.

355
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.720
She's going to sleep with the fishes.

356
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.400
Or at least witter on at them until they fucking lose the will to live. So, do you...?

357
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.480
(Do you have a plan?)

358
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.120
Optimum time for her to step down is eight months from now.

359
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.760
Over that period she has to be very gently dislodged -

360
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.680
like a tick from a cat's ear.

361
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.440
You set up that batpeople photo!

362
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.720
Olly, I'm shocked at you suggesting that.

363
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.760
Jiminy Fuckmas, Malcolm! I don't know about any of this.

364
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.240
It's time for you to step up, Olly. What's that film that you love?

365
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.400
What film? The one about the fucking hairdresser,

366
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.920
the space hairdresser and the cowboy.

367
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.960
The guy, he's got a tinfoil pal and a pedal bin.

368
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.400
His father's a robot and he's fucking fucked his sister.

369
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.800
LEGO, they're all made of fucking Lego.

370
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.720
Star Wars. That's the one, right.

371
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.280
It's like that, OK? You want to fucking kill the bad guys.

372
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.600
And you'll be able to blow up the big... The Death Star.

373
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.360
The Death Star thing.

374
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.480
Then you can go and live happily ever after

375
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.000
on the planet of the teddy bears. They're Ewoks, Ewoks.

376
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.560
It's a fantastic analogy, well done.

377
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.320
Are you, are you ABSOLUTELY sure about this, Malcolm?

378
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.360
Well, not really, no...

379
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.960
but it's worth a punt, isn't it?

380
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.240
Good. Life is interesting at last -

381
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.280
I've been so fucking bored for the last two years.

382
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.160
Bonnie Langford's paying.

383
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.760
It's a good speech, I think. Does it need a bit of a...? Rethink.

384
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.200
I was going to say trim.

385
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.320
Are you going to address the batpeople thing in the speech?

386
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.320
No, I might walk on stage to the theme tune!

387
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.400
Just make sure you're not wearing anything

388
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.040
that can be photographed like a cape.

389
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.680
Oh, Malcolm, did you see Dan?

390
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.040
I saw him and I fucking eviscerated him.

391
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.240
What did you say?

392
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.080
He crumpled like a crisp packet on a cooker.

393
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.320
He's now just a small pool of grease and regret, isn't he?

394
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.760
Yeah, yeah, you can only see him under UV lights now.

395
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.640
How do you know? Were you there?

396
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.440
Yeah, yeah. Malcolm flayed his skin off,

397
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.640
he's going to use it as his onesie. That's him just coming in.

398
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.880
Don't say anything.

399
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.000
Don't humiliate him any further - that's my fucking job.

400
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.600
Give us your dinner money! I haven't got dinner money, I bring a packed lunch.

401
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.560
Fuck that. I don't want one of your home-made fucking feta parcels.

402
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.680
I presume you need to bollock me for my disloyalty

403
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.600
in doing that New Statesman thing, so why don't we... I already have.

404
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.360
This morning - were you not there? Can't say I recall it.

405
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.960
Would it be cheeky if I invited you onto the veranda?

406
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.240
I've got a little matter I'd like to discuss with you.

407
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.880
We're lovers, deal with it.

408
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.040
I suppose the key question is,

409
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.800
is Dan Miller going to pull the same stunt again?

410
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.920
Well, I mean, I think, after what he's just been through with Malcolm,

411
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.480
Dan's crushed! He's just in the shower crying, with his clothes on!

412
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.800
Dan? Dan Miller? Yeah, Malcolm gave him a right old... K'cher!

413
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.160
He gave him a cash register?

414
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.400
No, that was me cracking a whip, plainly!

415
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.800
Well, shame I missed that, where was, er, where was this?

416
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.080
It was in the back stairwell.

417
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.800
That's right by my office. I'm surprised I didn't hear that.

418
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.800
I mean, I can hear fat Pat's farts bouncing off the walls

419
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.880
when she has to take the stairs if the lift's bust.

420
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.320
Well, it was, sort of, you know, he did it in a lower tone.

421
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.440
Special, kind of, terrifying... He calls it, erm, whisper boarding.

422
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.160
It's not a healthy sign when the deputy attacks the leader

423
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.160
but maybe we should embrace this point of no return.

424
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.440
Are you saying you agree with what I wrote?

425
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.320
I'm saying that I spoke to Nicola earlier,

426
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.880
to gauge the fire in her belly,

427
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.000
and now I'm standing in a cupboard with you.

428
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.040
What's the worst thing that he said?

429
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.200
Oh, well, he said, er, "Fuck right off, you fucker!"

430
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.440
Really? Well, I once used the last tea bag

431
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.040
and Malcolm pushed me up against a wall any called me Noncey Sinatra - that seems tame.

432
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.080
Well, like I say, it was, it was, it was mainly in the tone, Ben.

433
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.840
I didn't hold the door open for him and he called me a minge mop.

434
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.000
Yeah, but he likes Dan.

435
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.440
Ooh!

436
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.400
Did you need me?

437
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.360
Nope, nope.

438
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.680
So, your loyalty to Nicola is...?

439
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.760
Unwavering.

440
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.240
Right up to the point that...

441
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.760
Someone challenges her?

442
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.040
Not necessary, she's going to kick her own head in,

443
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.280
which will be easy for her because she does yoga.

444
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.040
We just need someone to hold her jacket

445
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.760
while she commits political hara-kiri

446
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.120
and sweep in unopposed...

447
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.240
being careful not to tread in the mess.

448
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.200
So, you think...

449
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.160
I should challenge her? What the fuck is this?

450
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.480
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Cunt?!

451
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.120
Do you or do you not want to be the next leader of this party?

452
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.280
Yes.

453
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.200
Well, she needs to fuck off in eight months,

454
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.000
so it looks like we're giving her a chance.

455
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.200
I will teach you the way of tears and love, my friend.

456
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.000
Now let's get out of this fucking cupboard

457
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.760
before Ben Swain comes in for his lunchtime wank.

458
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.160
And I agree that we no longer have the luxury,

459
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.120
the privilege of thinking in the abstract about politics.

460
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.760
How's Martina Luther King doing?

461
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.720
It's like that old show Faking It.

462
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.720
PHONE BEEPS

463
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.000
She's a shit politician pretending to be a,

464
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.320
pretending to be, er, a mediocre one.

465
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.040
What's that text? It's not a text.

466
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.000
Show me the text. It's telling me to tell you to mind your own business.

467
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.600
Show me the text! No, no, get off.

468
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.440
Show me. No, get off, it's a girl sexting me, Malcolm.

469
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.520
Practising for Strictly. Get off my fucking...

470
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.040
Give me my fucking...

471
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.280
What is this tiny font?

472
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.560
Is it to match your subatomic thoughts?

473
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.080
Give me my phone, Malcolm.

474
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.640
"As I thought, we're dropping BC," what does that mean?

475
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.400
That's my friend who works in education.

476
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.160
The government are dropping the reforms

477
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.720
to the primary school breakfast club policy.

478
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.520
OK, let's rewind here a bit, stick man.

479
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.560
Nicola is about to adopt a policy that is so toxic

480
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.480
that this stony-hearted government of fucking puppy killers is dropping it?

481
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.320
Yeah. Shit in my porridge.

482
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.920
Get a dart gun and go and fucking kill her.

483
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.680
No, no, think about it. This is exactly what we want, right?

484
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.960
No, think about it, this isn't what we want. This is too soon.

485
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.640
The mechanics of the leadership election are not in place.

486
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.880
Right, we've got to get her off that stage.

487
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.120
Go and piss in a fuse box, or finger a security guard.

488
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.280
I'll bundle her out during the melee. We need to stop Nicola announcing.

489
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.120
Rumour has it that the government is going to drop the breakfast club policy. Oh, shit!

490
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.440
But just a rumour, yeah?

491
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.800
Yes, I'm just getting it You need to signal her to stop.

492
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.960
You've got a signal? Er... We never agreed on one.

493
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.000
You don't have a fucking signal? You must, from Hampstead Heath?

494
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.160
Didn't Nicola mention something about iceberg?

495
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.960
As in you're going to crash into an iceberg. OK, how do I do that?

496
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.520
That's subtle(!) Get in, whatever it is. I'll do a triangle.

497
00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.720
In times of deep crisis, tribal politics can act as a break upon it.

498
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.760
And it's down...to us to rise above this and think...

499
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.240
What is that? Breached birth? It's a fucking iceberg.

500
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.680
Upside down uterus. Shut up, Olly!

501
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.760
..that we're endorsing fully and unreservedly

502
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.360
a pay freeze for the coastguard

503
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.880
AND an end to the ring-fencing of funds

504
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.880
to provide primary school breakfast clubs.

505
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.480
We are in concurrence with the government

506
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.320
because we are in unity with the British people.

507
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.920
Any questions?

508
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.880
Mrs Murray, did you know that the government have just announced

509
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.840
that they are dropping the reform on primary school breakfast clubs?

510
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.800
(Pretend you heard another question.)

511
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.280
Er, yes, yes, we, er, yes.

512
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.760
Breakfast, er, really is a...

513
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.680
really is a meal for the whole family, er, and, er...

514
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.000
I think that we regard that as...

515
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.360
You've got some nice fake concern going on there, Malcolm.

516
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.880
I'm sorry?

517
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.240
Undermining Nicola. You're getting off on this.

518
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.040
You've got some sort of agenda.

519
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.760
Don't you dare question my loyalty to my leader or my party ever again.

520
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.000
And don't flatter yourself into thinking that

521
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.240
you can divine my motives or actions.

522
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.720
You are a mouse in a maze.

523
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.680
..now that's not to say that if you don't have a family you,

524
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.120
you can't enjoy breakfast.

525
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.880
Plainly, you can and you should

526
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.080
because, erm, because it is the most important meal of the day,

527
00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.120
especially if you've been fasting during Eid.

528
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.040
I'm dead, aren't I? Why didn't you stop me?!

529
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.680
I tried to warn you.

530
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.320
Oh, with the triangle thing. W.T.Fuck was that?

531
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.200
Iceberg. Not to scale, obviously.

532
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.000
The iceberg you were heading for was much, MUCH bigger than that.

533
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.680
Do you know what I thought it was? Hash brown.

534
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.560
You see a triangle and the first thing that comes to your mind is hash brown? No...!

535
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.360
Bye-bye. Thank you.

536
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.280
Not the first thing, the first thing I thought was pyramid.

537
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.960
Pyramid, the signal being...? Being everything's fine.

538
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.280
You know, everybody likes pyramids.

539
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.440
Do we know why the fuckers dropped it?

540
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.960
Even the Etonian mess over at number ten has to acknowledge

541
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.600
that people hate the policy.

542
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.960
It's taking food out of children's mouths.

543
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.080
It is kind of the opposite of Comic Relief.

544
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.720
Well, then you should have stopped me!

545
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.480
You could have created a diversion -

546
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.360
you could have gone in there and set yourself on fire

547
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.000
or got your tits out and shouted, "Oh, there's a big lion!",

548
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.040
I don't know.

549
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.480
Just SOMETHING, just anything

550
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.400
rather than leave me in there committing career suicide

551
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.960
by starving small children.

552
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.400
And you, Malcolm, the one time in my life

553
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.320
I would've been actually pleased to see you. Where the fuck were you?

554
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.600
Sorry. Can you U-turn maybe?

555
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.120
No, that was a U-turn - if I do another U-turn it's an O-turn.

556
00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.880
Am I dead? No. No, no.

557
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.160
Cos I feel like I'm dead.

558
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.000
I feel like on Sunday I should just put the poppy wreath round my neck

559
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.840
and take 40 paracetamol. No, don't worry.

560
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.320
Look, we're all still Team Nicola. We'll fight for you, won't we?

561
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.960
Can somebody get me a coffee, please? God, yeah.

562
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.840
Hold the wreath in your right hand...

563
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.480
It's going to be heavier, isn't it? It's a practise wreath, I haven't weighed them.

564
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.520
Down, two...three, frown, two...three,

565
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.200
up and walk backwards.

566
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.920
Just copy the Queen, if in doubt.

567
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.080
That's going to have to do.

568
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.000
Good luck! Just, you know, knock 'em dead in a silent respectful manner!

569
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.080
Yeah. Phone off.

570
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.840
Ho-ho! Helen given you the wreath lecture?

571
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.360
Oh, come on, Nicola, you'll be absolutely fine.

572
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.680
I couldn't eat breakfast.

573
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.080
I felt like I'd personally ripped it out of the hands

574
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.760
of some malnourished infant. Stop it. Stop it.

575
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.360
The first rule of breakfast club is we do not talk about it.

576
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.400
That's it for now.

577
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.960
It's not just that, my head's full of BAT.

578
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.000
Because of the hat?

579
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.640
What? No because of the... Does this look like a bat?! No!

580
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.440
I was going to say it doesn't look like a...

581
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.680
It looks, it's more Mickey Mouse, isn't it? The hat?

582
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.160
Or Minnie Mouse, it's Minnie Mouse. Not bat.

583
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.840
Fuck off, Olly. OK.

584
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.120
Just wreath up that bad boy! OK. Yeah.

585
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.120
'Oh, and the DPM is up next.'

586
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.080
Firm grasp on the wreath, there.

587
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.760
He's aiming for the steps.

588
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.520
Top step! And that is...

589
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.720
magic poppies.

590
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.400
Oh, here we go.

591
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.200
She's flustered, isn't she?

592
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.600
That's the problem. She'll be fine.

593
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.680
Oh, my God.

594
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.760
Bollocking poppy wank!

595
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.760
Why is she hovering in the middle?!

596
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.800
You're right, she can't fucking walk.

597
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.160
I mean, shall we get a pony

598
00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.200
to challenge her?

599
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.520
It's not a fucking pony, it's a fucking foal.

600
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.920
Sorry.

601
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.400
I don't understand how you can get that wrong. It's this! Da, da, clonk!

602
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.840
She is officially a ceno-twat.

603
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.800
Fabulous work. Let's just, er...bury her in a grave...

604
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.720
The Unknown Leader.

605
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.600
I can't watch. I feel a bit sick.

606
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.160
I just hope there is no afterlife

607
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.480
because if people fought

608
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.600
and died for this

609
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.560
It is going to seem even more ridiculously futile.

610
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.000
Why do you know so much about horses anyway?

611
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.160
'I thought you were raised by wolves.'

613
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.960
First thoughts? We're policy jamming here.

614
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.320
ALL: Yes and ho.

615
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.400
Let's Macintyre this. Stand up.

616
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.560
I feel like I've joined the Scientologists.

617
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.560
Do you want to have an idea-gasm? Yes, please.

618
00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.960
She's some kind of economist.

619
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.360
I think we're looking at about two billion.

620
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.920
I quite like Emily Maitlis.

621
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.440
I'm sure she'd love a grey pounding.

622
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.040
HE SHOUTS

623
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.040
Is this what we came into politics for?

624
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.920
Yep. That and the pussy.
