WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.280
This programme contains
strong language.

00:05.280 --> 00:12.040
I'm impressed that you're seeing the
leader of your party. You should be.
But ultimately, he is just a man.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.720
Ah, that's a good point
because yours on the other hand is...

00:14.720 --> 00:18.560
No, no, no. Mine is
the leader of the country also.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.000
What I'm saying is,
if we were playing Top Trumps
which we kind of are...

00:23.000 --> 00:25.560
Of course, we absolutely are.
..I win.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.840
So, it's Ben Swain day today is it?

00:27.840 --> 00:29.880
Yep. A "Nutter" in our midst.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.280
A junior minister for me
to push around. That's nice.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.000
A bit more power for me. You are

00:32.280 --> 00:35.000
an extremely powerful man.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.680
Very powerful. Very attractive
sexually due to all this power.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.440
Hey Partridge!

00:40.440 --> 00:42.840
Hey dickhead.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.840
Happy New Queer. I'm really sorry.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.680
Don't be so offensive. I do
apologise for my friend's behaviour.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.560
Did you have a nice Poofmas?

00:49.560 --> 00:53.240
What are you two doing down
Richmond Terrace way? Slumming it.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.160
Seeing Julius, the big baldy ballbag.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.160
You must be Gemma. It's Emma.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.960
What are you doing here?
I'm babysitting Ben Swain today.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.280
Can you water my spider plants
in my office?

01:05.280 --> 01:07.880
He's very good with a watering can.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.680
Very, very bright lad.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.200
See you later.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.880
So the girlfriend, she doesn't mind
the whole your being gay thing?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.920
Did you take her home for Christmas?
No, God, no, couldn't do that.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.720
No, you couldn't do that cos she

01:22.920 --> 01:26.720
wouldn't fit in, cos you're
dyed-in-the-wool working class.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.960
She's probably
allergic to pit ponies.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.000
Are they actually sleeping together?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.600
Yes, in the flat.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.440
Do you think she's on top?

01:34.440 --> 01:40.640
What do you hear? I hear he'll say,
"How do you like it?" and she'll
say, "I've got to page Tucker."

01:40.640 --> 01:42.440
Have I shaved properly?

01:42.440 --> 01:47.240
We're having the bathroom done and
I was in the kitchen this morning

01:42.440 --> 01:47.240
using the kettle as a mirror.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.200
No, you're very smooth.
It's a chrome kettle then?

01:49.200 --> 01:52.960
You've been watching
CSI again, haven't you?

01:52.960 --> 01:55.759
Morning.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.759
Oh, hello.
How was sleeping with the enemy?

01:55.759 --> 01:58.120
Oh, hilarious.
I'd forgotten how funny you were.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.120
What time are you seeing Stewart?

02:00.120 --> 02:04.520
It'll be in about half an hour.
What about you? Oh, I'll be last in.

02:04.520 --> 02:11.520
He's punishing me for standing
against JB in the leadership contest
by putting me in the Ryanair queue.

02:11.520 --> 02:16.120
Come on. He got you that terrific
photo-op with that wind-turbine
on your house, remember?

02:16.120 --> 02:18.520
Yes, and it cost me 12 grand.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.680
And I had to pay for the electricity
bill to keep the bugger turning.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.560
Because there's no wind
in the valley. I had to plug it in.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.800
My next door neighbour
has an England flag that

02:27.800 --> 02:31.840
hangs there limply while my turbine
mysteriously whizzes around.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.240
You could turn the turbine round
so it blows his flag.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.360
So what's up first then, Peter?

02:37.360 --> 02:43.040
While we're here, we could bat ideas
around. He wants something fluffy for

02:37.360 --> 02:43.040
the speech, does he? Environment?

02:43.040 --> 02:47.920
Tax breaks for aromatherapists?
Satnav for asylum seekers?

02:47.920 --> 02:51.760
I was thinking about a departmental
blog. Oh, God! Really?

02:51.760 --> 02:55.920
I could do the writing bit of it
because you wouldn't have time.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.640
I might as well.
I've knack all else to do...

02:59.640 --> 03:01.920
To be honest, you sort it out.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.440
I thought we could have a
guest book so readers could leave
their comments. Are you sure?

03:06.440 --> 03:08.960
Have you ever Googled your own name?

03:08.960 --> 03:13.360
It's like opening a door to a room
where everyone tells you
how shit you are.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.960
Where's my little phoney, Ben Swain?

03:15.960 --> 03:17.960
What's this Newsnight angle
going to be then?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.120
Ben's going on Newsnight?

03:20.120 --> 03:23.840
Oh, you're a little West Winger,
aren't you? They cutting
you out of the loop already?

03:23.840 --> 03:26.280
Well, I'll check who
the presenter is and...

03:26.280 --> 03:28.040
The presenter is Newsbot 3.2.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.760
It's a nobody.
It's a fucking scorch mark.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.440
Paxo's in Kenya fly-fishing
with Stephen Fry
or whatever the fuck he does.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.440
Kirsty is in Kilmarnock with her
gran. So she's out of the picture.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.840
Well, I'll just check the lines
with Pat Morrissey. Pat Morrissey?

03:40.840 --> 03:43.920
What her? Fat Pat? Pumpkin tits?

03:43.920 --> 03:49.840
Yeah. Pat and Communications
have asked that everything
be double ticked through her.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.920
But you get to tick as well.
Obviously.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.320
Oh, obviously(!)
That's very, very nice.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.040
That's very fucking big of them.

03:56.040 --> 04:00.960
I get a tick? Yeah it's two ticks
for a green light basically.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.960
Pat Morrissey. Communications is
full of "Nutters" these days.

04:03.960 --> 04:08.680
Soon as the PM said he'd be gone
inside a year, the "Nutters" started
pouring out, like mela-fucking-noma.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.320
See you later. See you in a tick.

04:10.320 --> 04:15.360
What about you? You're not
a "Nutter", are you?
I'm not a "Nutter".

04:15.360 --> 04:16.880
I'm a "Nipper".

04:18.760 --> 04:21.760
Hey, Terri.
Hi Ollie. Happy New Year.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.320
How was Christmas? Oh, you know.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.880
Yeah, I know. Six pairs of socks,
three Harry Potter omnibuses.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.000
"I thought
you were taking the giblets out."

04:29.000 --> 04:33.640
"Don't give Nan any more Baileys,
she's only got the one pad
with her." Every bloody year.

04:33.640 --> 04:38.080
Yeah, well, you know it was
just me and Mum, at the care home.
Right. Jesus.

04:38.080 --> 04:43.120
So Ben on Newsnight? Ben Swain
is going on Newsnight? Yeah, yeah.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.159
Thank God you didn't know either.
I thought it was just me.

04:46.159 --> 04:48.280
No, no.
I did know about that actually.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.000
Why did you say it like that then?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.960
"Ben Swain's going on Newsnight?"
You're just out of the loop.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.840
I'm very well wired
into the Tommists.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.440
Nobody calls them Tommists.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.480
They're "Nutters", Terri.
Nobody calls them Tommists.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.440
I don't like the word "nutters".
My sister works in mental health.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.960
Right, um, well.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.760
There's plenty of room
so take a seat.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.000
Lots of places to sit and make
yourselves feel comfortable.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.120
Feel free to sit down
if you'd like to.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.560
You're welcome to sit
wherever you like.

05:14.560 --> 05:21.000
I'm fine here. Good.

05:14.560 --> 05:21.000
I was just saying we are on
our eighth legacy working party!

05:21.000 --> 05:25.920
Already! Yes,
it's the eighth already
so that's a congratulatory matter.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.560
OK, I want to reinforce the fact
that what we're doing here,

05:30.560 --> 05:33.800
is we're moving immigration out
of frontline politics.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.560
It's no longer some sort of
political football we can throw
about here and throw about there.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.560
No, we're going to push asylum
policy across to this independent

05:41.560 --> 05:45.760
expert board,
totally independent from Government.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.440
That will be the legacy.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.680
We should perhaps... I'll tell you
what his legacy is going to be.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.960
He'll be the one to
try to have a legacy.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.640
JULIUS: I think we ought to
keep on our agenda, Malcolm,

05:54.960 --> 06:00.640
so that's not for the minutes.

06:00.640 --> 06:04.320
Thanks for that. I will action that.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.440
Right, are we ready to continue?
Good, OK, well,

06:06.440 --> 06:11.640
you can take your comments to the
Prime Minister directly because when
I speak to him, and I do frequently,

06:11.640 --> 06:16.200
obviously, not just to discuss this
but also the delicate matter
of the timing of the departure...

06:16.200 --> 06:18.120
Do you know the departure date?

06:18.120 --> 06:21.560
Mal, look...

06:18.120 --> 06:21.560
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

06:21.560 --> 06:25.240
This is off the minutes now. Yes,
I have been told the departure date.

06:25.240 --> 06:33.240
You actually know it? James, as if

06:25.240 --> 06:33.240
I'm going to sit here now and reveal
that confidential information. OK.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.600
Forget it, forget the whole thing.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.280
Can I take some time off at Easter
by the way? Of course... Sorry,

06:39.280 --> 06:42.480
it's not Easter. It's not Easter.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.320
Stop it. We're just going
to go round and round. 12th June.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.080
No, Malcolm. 12th June?

06:49.080 --> 06:56.040
No, the Prime Minister will reveal
the dates... 13th? 14th? ..when
he reveals the date. There it is.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.600
Could you reveal the date
on which he'll reveal the date?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.200
Would that be possible?

07:01.200 --> 07:03.360
You don't even have to say.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.040
Just, when I, just nod... Julius.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.960
When I point to the right date,
just nod your head.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.080
Just say that's the date.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.080
Don't mess about.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.640
Will this help to fuck
the "Nutters" or not?

07:16.640 --> 07:20.640
Look, James, those "Nutters",
they do not operate in a vacuum.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.200
They're part of the party.
They're part of Government.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.240
I mean, Ben Swain's
going on Newsnight tonight.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.480
God knows what's that's
going to throw up. His lunch.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.920
It'll be a big nothing, junior
"Nutter" interviewed by dwarf hack.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.560
No, no, that is a Paxman interview.

07:35.560 --> 07:39.520
It's not Paxman. Are you sure?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.360
Yes, Malcolm, I'm sure it's Paxman.
I have just spoken to Pat Morrissey.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.120
She confirmed it half an hour ago.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.040
She's ticked this?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.200
Well, that's fine,

07:52.200 --> 07:54.200
he's lost his teeth anyway.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.800
He's like Russell
fucking Harty these days.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.120
Only without that element of danger.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.960
What happened to my tick?

08:00.960 --> 08:04.880
I've just got it,
now Pat's taken it away.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.360
It's a two-tick system
and she's got both fucking ticks?

08:08.360 --> 08:10.520
Pumpkin ticks.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.440
She's got a fucking
enormous box as well.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.480
Do you think Paxman wants to do it
because he's found out
about this computer fuck-up?

08:16.480 --> 08:19.800
I hoped we could keep a lid on that
till Hugh got back.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.240
Still late in, Ollie.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.520
Opposition have you tied
to the bedposts?

08:24.520 --> 08:28.520
Covered all over in right wing
whipped cream all the way
from "Thought for the Day"?

08:28.520 --> 08:31.080
What are you doing in?
I thought you were on holiday whilst

08:31.080 --> 08:35.000
Hugh is on his horrible Australian
nuptials and small-talk nightmare.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.280
Yes, I am.
I just popped in for the handover.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.520
Where are you off to?
Somewhere nice, hotel...

08:39.520 --> 08:42.320
No, I'm going down to Wales.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.840
I promised my sister
I'd do her place up.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.880
Didn't expect her to go
and buy the fucking paint, did I?

08:47.880 --> 08:53.880
By the way, I ran past Hugh
the idea of the coalface.
"Week At The Coalface" thing.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.840
My idea? No, Malcolm's idea.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.280
No, well, Malcolm had a concept
and I fleshed it out, didn't I?

08:59.280 --> 09:02.920
"I fashioned the narrative,
nigger" as we say in Brixton.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.400
Whatever. If Hugh liked it,
it would have been my idea.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.240
But, he didn't so it's yours.
And anyway it's not happening.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.080
What is he talking about?
It's a genius idea.

09:10.080 --> 09:15.240
Having a politician, a minister,
not just a politician, going into
an Immigration Centre for a week

09:15.240 --> 09:19.200
and work shoulder to shoulder with
real people, well, not real people,

09:15.240 --> 09:19.200
civil servants. But, you know.

09:19.200 --> 09:25.480
Morning all. Big Ben, Benjy, Benjy.
Welcome. Happy New Year. Benj.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.280
Happy New Year to you as well.
These are your briefing notes.

09:28.280 --> 09:32.040
Ah, splendid. I'll file these
directly in the shredder.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.160
If you just stick to what's
in there you'll be all right.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.840
Just remember, you're the night
watchman, all right?

09:36.840 --> 09:41.040
Well, I like to think of myself
as more of an elected MP
than a night watchman, Glenn.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.120
But thanks for everything. I'll be
fine without you holding my hand.

09:44.120 --> 09:49.680
You enjoy your weekend cottaging
in Wales or whatever it is
you're up to. This is looking good.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.960
When is it out? End of the week.
You can make the launch party.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.480
Great title. And have you written
it yourself or is it ghosted by...?

09:57.480 --> 10:01.920
By Victoria Beckham.
No, everything in there is written
by me, I think you'll find.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.560
There you go.
You have hidden talents.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.000
Anyone heard from the Hughster?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.800
Yes, he's suffering from jet lag.

10:07.800 --> 10:12.280
Have you been to Australia? No.
Why would I want to go there? Full
of people in khakis, squinting.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.280
It's just the world's largest
collection of poisonous things.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.920
God, yeah. If you wanted to
stick around with poisonous snakes,
you might as well as stay here.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.080
Throw a blanket on me. I'm on fire.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.600
Listen. Ollie,
We may be babysitting a "Nutter".

10:26.600 --> 10:30.200
He may look like a Womble but he's
got "Nutter" eyes and "Nutter" ears.

10:30.200 --> 10:36.240
Keep an eye on him. The moment any
chicken blood turns up on the
paperwork, I'll be on to you. Right.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.600
Off to Wales, and the late 1950s.
Happy trails.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.120
HE COUGHS

10:42.400 --> 10:44.120
Can't get rid of this.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.880
Bet you're looking forward
to your holiday. Well, yeah.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.720
Obviously, I'm not flying abroad
anywhere because... ..Carbon.

10:50.720 --> 10:57.120
No, bathroom.
Supervising doing up my bathroom.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.720
Is that raffia?

10:57.120 --> 11:00.720
He's discovered IKEA, hasn't he?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.480
It's all for show.

11:02.480 --> 11:07.560
They want to look modern, like
they appeal to the kind of people
who go to IKEA. I'm modern.

11:07.560 --> 11:12.240
I say "black" instead of "coloured".
I think women are a good thing.
I have no problem with gays.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.480
Most of them are very well
turned out, especially the men.

11:15.480 --> 11:21.680
Why is it, this last year, I've been
made to feel as if I'm always two
steps behind, like I can't programme

11:21.680 --> 11:25.080
a video or convert everything back
to old money? Because that's not me.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.880
You still have a video?
I'm a one nation party.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.960
THEY LAUGH

11:30.960 --> 11:33.320
Ah, Peter.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.320
PETER COUGHS

11:33.320 --> 11:35.600
Dr Stewart will see you now.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.320
Did I hear you coughing in there?

11:37.320 --> 11:40.600
Is that your contribution to
the meeting? Are you all right?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.040
Yes, OK. It's just hanging around.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.560
Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you hanging
about but right now all the,

11:46.560 --> 11:49.520
all the big priority stuff
is the big party stuff.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.280
I was talking about the cold,
hanging around.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.080
Thanks very much, Emma.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.200
You OK?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.160
Was that fun there?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.160
Yeah, useful.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.400
Playing with the big boys?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.520
Yes. Now, I'm back
with the little boys.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.000
No.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.880
So. How are you then?

12:08.880 --> 12:11.000
Fine, I'm fine.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.040
Superb. Now, the reason I asked
you in - firstly, just to say hi,

12:11.000 --> 12:16.040
how are you? Still fine.

12:16.040 --> 12:22.880
Then this photo call this afternoon,
"100 days of the new leader".

12:16.040 --> 12:22.880
We've got you a Paul Smith suit.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.520
I did think about Vivienne Westwood.
But it was just too expensive.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.440
And a Ted Baker,

12:30.440 --> 12:32.080
Ted Baker shirt.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.600
No tie, we're thinking
an open-necked look might be good.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.520
I'm already wearing a suit.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.320
And, controversially, a tie.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.040
Absolutely. Sure.
But frankly, it looks a bit '80s.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.280
Robert Palmer, Sink the Belgrano,
that kind of vibe.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.400
We think this is better, it's
modern, sharp, slimming. Try it on.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.800
Is this a joke? Try the suit on.

12:56.800 --> 13:03.360
Just wondering whether you're fully
conversant with the new line,
whether you're really up to speed.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.440
I don't know. Am I?

13:03.360 --> 13:07.440
Because I get people stopping me

13:07.440 --> 13:11.800
in the street and saying, "Are you
still for locking up yobbos?"

13:11.800 --> 13:16.200
And I say, "Yes, of course we are."
But then I think, "Are we?"

13:16.200 --> 13:18.840
Maybe I missed a memo from you.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.840
Maybe I should understand
yobbos now.

13:21.840 --> 13:28.280
Not even call them yobbos,
call them "Young Men With Issues
Around Stabbing".

13:30.560 --> 13:34.080
No tie, you say? No tie.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.000
It's quite a nice suit actually.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.160
So, we were thinking,

13:39.160 --> 13:40.880
shirt outside the trousers.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.480
Outside?

13:44.480 --> 13:46.960
Not tuck my shirt in? Yeah.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.360
I always tuck my shirt in,
it's part of getting dressed.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.080
Shall I not do my flies up either?

13:54.080 --> 13:55.680
Let the old chap flop out.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.680
Is that modern enough for you?

13:57.680 --> 13:59.960
Just try it, Peter.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.120
Not the cock out, the shirt thing.

14:04.760 --> 14:10.040
I'm from a generation of men,
Stewart, who tuck their shirts in.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.560
I have done it since I was a boy.
I was told off for not doing it.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.600
Oh God. No, you're right. Sorry.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.920
Tuck it in. You look like you've
been startled by a fire alarm.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.360
Mr Swain.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.400
Morning Ben. Morning Malcolm.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.120
Off you two fuck.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.080
Right, Ben,
heard the big news about Paxo.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.560
What was it you did
in your gap year again?

14:35.560 --> 14:38.080
Er, inter-railing.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.680
Have you ever travelled
100 miles an hour head-first
through a tunnel of pig shit?

14:42.680 --> 14:47.400
Because that's what's going
to happen to you tonight with
Paxman unless you listen to us.

14:47.400 --> 14:52.000
He'll eat you up, sick you out and
grout his fucking wet room with you.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.440
I have been interviewed before,
thank you very much. Who?

14:55.440 --> 14:57.920
George Alagiah.
Yeah? You know what they call him?

14:57.920 --> 15:00.600
"Easy George". This is Paxo.

15:00.600 --> 15:07.000
What are you gonna do when he pulls
that big rubbery horse face
of mock incredulity at you?

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
We know the cheat codes for Paxman
now. That old aggressive style
is just old school.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.720
All you do is play the honest Joe,
try to humbly get your point across.

15:14.720 --> 15:20.680
Let's see you do your stuff,
Mr Television.

15:20.680 --> 15:25.400
Immigration's in disarray,
what are you going to do about it?

15:25.400 --> 15:29.120
First, I would have to take issue
with your contention
that immigration is in disarray.

15:29.120 --> 15:33.120
Oh, answer the question,
you fat fuck.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.760
You panicked already.
You shat yourself.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.760
Well, he won't swear at me
like that on live television.
He'd just look ridiculous.

15:39.760 --> 15:44.040
What are you going to say when he
brings up this computer fuck-up?

15:39.760 --> 15:44.040
You're going to need something.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.160
There's an idea of Ollie's that we
could use. "A Week At The Coalface".

15:48.160 --> 15:51.440
What I'll do is go into an
immigration office, spend a couple

15:51.440 --> 15:55.080
of days there working on the front
line with the people in the office.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.880
That's MY fucking idea.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.960
I said Hugh should do that
at a drop-in centre.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.600
You know. I did finesse it a bit.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.440
Let's just use it,, all right.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.000
Jamie's going to stay with you.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.960
He'll be by your side
until the interview is over,
even if you take a dump.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.600
Even if I take a dump.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.640
And I shit a lot. It's smoking
and a fast metabolism.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.240
Well, fantastic. We'll spend
the day defecating together.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.840
It's the glamour of this job
I so much enjoy.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.160
Malcolm reckons Newsnight will be
an absolute shuttle crash.

16:40.160 --> 16:45.680
But we've given Ben one of my very
fine ideas as a secret weapon
just in case. Oh, yeah. What's that?

16:45.680 --> 16:51.320
We send him to an immigration centre
in Watford for a week, work shoulder

16:45.680 --> 16:51.320
to shoulder with the drones.

16:51.320 --> 16:55.440
"A Week At The Coalface", see what
the problems are from the inside.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.080
That's actually really nice.
Oh, yeah. I'm a genius.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.800
Paxman versus Swain.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.680
Bare knuckle backstreet talking.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.720
Oh, are you off? What a shame.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.119
I am off for a massive shit, Phil.
Which one's your toothbrush again?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.079
Topsy and Tim? That one?

17:12.079 --> 17:15.040
Why the fuck do you have to keep
inviting him round here?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.680
Are you a bit jealous?

17:16.680 --> 17:19.319
What, of the man
from the Mr Muscle adverts?

17:19.319 --> 17:22.920
No. It's unreasonable. I have to
watch what I say in my own flat.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.920
You could at least give me warning
if he's coming round or something.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.800
I'll put a sex grid on the fridge
so you can have dates and stuff.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.920
I'll put an A4 piece of paper up and
you could have a half a Post-it note.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.920
You can share that
with Affers maybe.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.920
You'd have to write really small.
"I've slept with three women in..."
Your life? Yes.

17:41.920 --> 17:46.600
PUTS UP VOLUME ON TV

17:41.920 --> 17:46.600
Here we go. Seconds out.
Come on Big Ben.

17:46.600 --> 17:52.800
PAXMAN: 'Where do you stand
on the number of illegal

17:46.600 --> 17:52.800
immigrants in this country?'

17:52.800 --> 17:56.720
'I'm sure you'd like me to....
I'D like to answer that question

17:56.720 --> 18:03.080
'and I'm sure you'd like to rush me
into an answer...' He doesn't look

17:56.720 --> 18:03.080
relaxed. It's his first time though.

18:03.080 --> 18:07.320
'..He's not really
what the question is about.'

18:07.320 --> 18:10.960
What's he doing with his eyes?

18:10.960 --> 18:14.320
Oh my God, he's got a nervous blink.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.040
That's a mega blink.

18:16.040 --> 18:20.440
It's not just A blink. He looks like
what happens when you punch a cow.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.200
'That's 500 million pounds over...'

18:24.200 --> 18:31.080
'Well, over... I'll answer
your first question before

18:24.200 --> 18:31.080
you ask me another one, Jeremy.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.680
'That's how it...normally works.'

18:33.680 --> 18:38.080
This is like watching a lion
rape a sheep, but in a bad way.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.600
The cameramen are laughing. '£100
million a year. I mean, j-j-just...'

18:41.600 --> 18:43.880
Stop him, stop him.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.560
He spelt "just" with four Js.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.600
He's like a chicken.
He's like an enormous chicken.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.640
'100 million pounds a year.
I'm quoting your own accounts.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.880
'Yes, you can quote from my accounts
and I can quote from your accounts

18:55.880 --> 18:59.480
'and we'd both be quoting
from our accounts.'

18:59.480 --> 19:02.800
It's just one word he's been
saying which is basically...

19:02.800 --> 19:04.560
HE MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY

19:04.560 --> 19:08.640
What about the coalface?
Pull it. Punch his life belt,
pull it, give him the signal.

19:08.640 --> 19:15.000
'If he shits I'll give you 500
quid.' 'What's your solution?

19:08.640 --> 19:15.000
One solution package we're having.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.800
'My solution... The answer to
the question is you don't know.

19:18.800 --> 19:23.400
'No, I do and I wish
you'd stop saying that.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.880
'You don't know. It's er...
Minister, thank you.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.640
'Well, no, not yet.
Minister, thank you very much.'

19:30.640 --> 19:35.520
He looked like a "Nutter". He looked
like that guy on the green who
shouts "You're an Arab!" at everyone.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.760
It's a tough day tomorrow picking
bits of Ben out of Malcolm's car.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.840
He didn't mention the coalface idea.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.960
You don't deserve to live.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.880
That was the worst thing
I've ever seen. And I was in 'Nam.

19:55.880 --> 20:00.040
It was fucking funny though, wasn't
it? I've just rung Hugh, actually.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.040
It's first thing over there
and it's made his day.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.560
Haven't heard him
sound so happy in years.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.240
'That doesn't sound like Hugh.'

20:07.240 --> 20:10.840
'No. Well, he rang back 30 seconds
later panicking.'

20:07.240 --> 20:10.840
CLATTERING

20:10.840 --> 20:14.920
So what did you say? Hang on a
second... Can you fuck off?
I'm having a conversation.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.680
Oh sorry. I'll go home.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.400
Oh, hang on a minute, this IS my
home, so why don't YOU fuck off?

20:20.400 --> 20:23.800
'What's going on?' Sorry mate,
just some twat being annoying.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.400
You're not at your girlfriend's?
Don't say anything you shouldn't.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.080
Oh, tit, you know what?

20:29.080 --> 20:32.760
I gave her the codes for the nukes.
And she's got PMT. We're all dead.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.520
'What do you think?' I'm serious.

20:34.520 --> 20:40.600
'Yes, me too.' Ollie, the "Nutters"
want to know if you're coming back

20:34.520 --> 20:40.600
in for the line dancing? 'Fuck off.'

20:40.600 --> 20:42.200
How's my blog?

20:42.200 --> 20:45.480
My own personal blog,
personally written by me?

20:45.480 --> 20:48.720
There we go. Yesterday you liked
the leader's speech.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.080
It was bold and courageous
and sent out the right signals.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.240
And you had a fruit lunch.
Oh, I write very well.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.160
What's the feedback like?

20:56.160 --> 20:59.840
That's on this page here. Here we go.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.760
"I don't trust you,
you Cypriot crook."

21:03.760 --> 21:09.200
Cypriot? This is the shit room,
you've opened the shit room door.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.480
That's not too bad.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.480
"How are the maintenance payments
going on your bastard?"

21:13.480 --> 21:15.040
Christ, that was 12 years ago.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.880
I hadn't seen that one.
"Adulterous Nazi". Or that one.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.760
That's actually the same one.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.920
This is the trouble with the public.
They're fucking horrible.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.320
Peter, you really, you can't say
the public are fucking horrible.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.680
Yes, I can. I've met them.
"You've always got
such a pained expression.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.800
"Do you take it up the chutney?2

21:32.800 --> 21:34.560
Really. For God's sake.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.480
The chutney? I still don't understand

21:34.560 --> 21:39.480
why people do this H8 thing.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.040
If you leave a message,
spell it correctly.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.040
If you're going to say "I hate you".

21:43.040 --> 21:46.640
Morning all. Turn it off.
Minimise it.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.040
What we looking at? Just the blog.
How's it going?

21:51.040 --> 21:55.000
The blog is great. It's here.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Nice picture, isn't it?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Nice picture, nice hair.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
OK, right.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.840
Who saw Mr Swain
on Newsnight last night?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.360
Yes!

22:03.360 --> 22:05.080
Certainly did. Certainly did.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.080
And the blinking.

22:07.080 --> 22:12.360
Look. Ben Swain's made immigration
an issue, we should be capitalising

22:07.080 --> 22:12.360
on this while Hugh's away.

22:12.360 --> 22:16.120
Ah, now, hang on. Ministers and

22:12.360 --> 22:16.120
Shadows agree holidays together.

22:16.120 --> 22:21.600
Hugh's away, and I'm away

22:16.120 --> 22:21.600
from tomorrow - not in Australia

22:16.120 --> 22:21.600
but in my bathroom.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.000
Are you an Ameri-can
or an Ameri-can't, Peter?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.080
What does that mean?
That doesn't mean anything.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.600
It's not even a word.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.600
I'm an Ameri-can.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.040
Great, let's get some ideas
kicking about. Come on?

22:36.040 --> 22:38.760
OK. Um...

22:38.760 --> 22:41.560
I was thinking Peter could possibly

22:41.560 --> 22:47.280
spend some time at an immigration
centre in London or just outside.

22:47.280 --> 22:52.720
Getting in there and spending
a couple of days at the coalface,

22:52.720 --> 22:56.760
portraying an image of really
being involved in the...

22:56.760 --> 22:59.640
How would that... Phil,
have you got some thoughts on this?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.800
It would just be sort
of fact-finding.

23:01.800 --> 23:06.480
Right, I want to see you Peter, out
and about at an immigration centre.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.320
Croydon, Watford,
somewhere bleak anyway.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.240
Yes, of course you do.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.560
What the fuck was that about,
nicking the other lot's ideas?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.760
You jumped straight on
the band wagon, you hypocrite.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.000
You started it. At least I'm
not nicking my boyfriend's ideas.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.240
You sanctimonious twat.

23:21.240 --> 23:25.280
You're not my dad, Phil,
even if you do dress like him.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.920
What's going on?
Swain was supposed to flag

23:27.920 --> 23:31.200
up the coalface idea last night
but he didn't. So Emma nicked it.

23:32.280 --> 23:37.200
Fuck-tastic. Not only was it
a shit idea to ruin my holiday,

23:37.200 --> 23:42.360
it was a shit idea you stole
from the Government
to ruin my holiday. Good work.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.560
Thanks a lot, supergrass.

23:44.560 --> 23:48.080
You're such a bum-licker, Phil.
Why do you suck up to him so much?

23:48.080 --> 23:51.880
Is it cos he was around in the '80s?
You dress like you're in the '80s.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.000
There's nothing wrong with the '80s.
Good things came out of the '80s.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.480
Miami Vice, deregulation
of the stock exchange.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.800
Us being in power.
Pretty bloody good, wasn't it?

23:59.800 --> 24:02.720
What is this? Sexual tension?
Fuck off. I'd rather pay for it.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.520
I'd rather eat my own shit.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.520
Well, take it elsewhere.

24:05.520 --> 24:09.240
They're with the grouting
in the garage.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.320
Don't you talk to Ollie about this.
Not until I've spoken to him.

24:12.320 --> 24:16.520
Fine by me, although he is going
to know we're announcing it,
because we're announcing it.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.360
(You're such a twat.)

24:20.360 --> 24:23.240
You just email it in, straight away.
It's up on his blog.

24:23.240 --> 24:28.760
I sent him one that said, "Yeah,
I totally agree, school children
should be allowed to carry knives".

24:28.760 --> 24:30.400
Here he is.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.800
Dead man walking.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.440
AS SWAIN: "I-I-I wish
you wouldn't keep saying that."

24:35.440 --> 24:36.960
Who's your favourite band?

24:36.960 --> 24:38.680
Blink 182?

24:38.680 --> 24:45.520
Ollie look, Phil pitched Stewart the
coalface idea and he's gone with it.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.280
'I just thought I'd warn you.'

24:47.280 --> 24:51.280
Oh, thanks a bundle.
"I'm warning you
you've got three minutes to live."

24:51.280 --> 24:53.680
What am I supposed to do,
boil a fucking egg?

24:53.680 --> 24:56.200
HE COUGHS VIOLENTLY

24:56.200 --> 25:00.640
Oh! That's like smoking dead skin.

25:00.640 --> 25:06.840
That's not a proper cigar. Proper
cigars are those big Cuban whoppers.
That's just a jumped-up fag.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.880
Talking of which... Hi.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.480
Is it rag week?

25:10.480 --> 25:13.480
Do you fancy a cigar? I won't tell
the other prefects.

25:13.480 --> 25:19.880
Hand rolled on the thigh of a Cuban
virgin with big tits and four kids.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.840
Thanks. Malcolm, I just wanted
to have a quick word actually.

25:23.840 --> 25:29.600
The opposition have got the
"Week At The Coalface" idea

25:23.840 --> 25:29.600
and they're doing it. Who? When?

25:29.600 --> 25:33.280
Peter Mannion, I don't know when.
How the fuck did they get that?

25:33.280 --> 25:35.520
It's your fucking girlfriend!

25:35.520 --> 25:40.000
Jesus Christ. You should have
dumped that mad bitch ages ago.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.720
I would have done. She is mad.

25:41.720 --> 25:46.640
She's a mental woman. But you two
kept telling me to go out with
her and stay going out with her

25:46.640 --> 25:50.920
in case I found anything out. And

25:46.640 --> 25:50.920
what did you find out? That you're
leaking intelligence to them?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.640
You're the fucking shittest
James Bond ever.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.680
You're David fucking Niven.

25:56.680 --> 26:01.000
Terri, are you still here?
Put your glass down
and meet me in the kitchen.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.440
Just follow the fucking crumbs.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.120
What is going on
with this coalface bullshit, Terri?

26:07.120 --> 26:12.400
What's this? I don't understand. The
opposition fact-finding immigration.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.680
There was an official request
this afternoon
from Stewart Pearson, their PR guy.

26:15.680 --> 26:20.720
I saw no legitimate reason to stop
it and he was very nice. He was nice?

26:20.720 --> 26:25.000
Good manners cost nothing. Just
because you were raised by wolves.
Is it this easy to get in

26:25.000 --> 26:30.800
your knickers, because if were you I
would go down to the clap clinic and
get them to get a good look up you.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.880
I followed the procedure.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.880
Did you get two ticks?

26:32.880 --> 26:35.120
No, I didn't have
to do the two ticks.

26:35.120 --> 26:39.120
I put a memo through to Julius.
He okayed it and it is going ahead.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.640
Excuse me, Ben,
come here, we need to talk.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.840
Hi, Glenn.
Something might be happening.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.800
It'll probably be on News 24.
I haven't got digital here.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.360
I've barely got terrestrial.
It's fucking barbaric.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.880
PHONE RINGS

26:57.880 --> 27:00.480
Malcolm Tucker.
What do I owe the pleasure?

27:00.480 --> 27:03.880
This coalface bullshit is going
to make us look like a
bunch of government wankers.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.640
We will not look like gurning people.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.640
They point out the problems.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.760
We solve it. It's a damn sight more
subtle than raising it ourselves.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.480
You actually want
the opposition to do this?

27:15.480 --> 27:19.280
We are through the looking
glass now, folks. Fuck me.

27:19.280 --> 27:24.320
I'm going to get my little phoney,
young Benjamin, to announce that

27:24.320 --> 27:31.360
he's going to the coalface and we're
gonna do this before the wankers do.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.000
OK. You two, come with me.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.280
Get him properly
fucking screen tested.

27:42.280 --> 27:46.840
I'm sorry but you need powder.
I've never seen anyone look
so fucking ugly with just one head.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.360
No, I lost my islands of safety.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.240
Who was it who did your media
training? Myra Hindley?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.800
It's terrible, the hands
were all over the place.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.640
It was like a sweaty octopus
trying to unhook a bra.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.840
It was like watching
John Leslie at work.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.840
Yes. I know all of that.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.840
It just kind of fell away.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.480
God, it was like one of those
dreams where you're wandering round

28:08.480 --> 28:11.040
Covent Garden in just a vest
and everyone's staring at you.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.160
It was much worse than that. How

28:11.040 --> 28:15.160
many people see you in Covent Garden?

28:15.160 --> 28:20.160
A few thousand? Your meltdown
was witnessed by 1.2 million people.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.120
That's more people than saw
Al Jolson in his entire career.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.440
And that's Al fucking Jolson.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.840
He loves Al Jolson. The guv'nor.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.840
HE BAAS LIKE A SHEEP

28:29.840 --> 28:34.160
You take the piss out of Jolson again

28:29.840 --> 28:34.160
and I will remove your iPod from

28:34.160 --> 28:37.600
its tiny Nano sheath
and push it up your cock.

28:37.600 --> 28:43.520
Then I'll plug some speakers
up your arse and put it
on shuffle with my fucking fist.

28:43.520 --> 28:48.000
And every time I hear something
I don't like, which will be
every time something comes on,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.600
I will skip to the next track
by crushing your balls.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.160
Bollocks! They've shot their wad.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.440
They've announced it already.
They beat us to it?

28:58.440 --> 29:00.480
You two fuck off.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.760
You stay here, I need to kill you.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.680
Why didn't you just tell me?

29:05.680 --> 29:08.520
Why did you have to say
it was Phil who did it?

29:08.520 --> 29:10.400
It kind of was Phil.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.520
In what way was it "kind of Phil"
when you fucking nicked it?

29:14.520 --> 29:20.400
I should have told you sooner but
I couldn't because Stewart had
to stop Malcolm from blocking it.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.520
It's just... ..The game we're in.
Yeah.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.480
Oh, good, it's Hugh Grant.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.000
How are you two love birds
getting on? Fuck off, Phil.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.600
Phil, this isn't
the time for this.

29:30.600 --> 29:35.120
What? To be in my own flat?
It never is because this
fucking stalker is always here.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.560
I'll have to get a restraining
order against you.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.480
Yeah, yeah, did you steal
any ideas on your way home, Phil?

29:40.480 --> 29:42.600
Is this coalface?
Yes, of course it's coalface.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.760
Well A) I thought that idea
had been around

29:44.760 --> 29:47.520
so long it was out of copyright
like an old folk song.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.640
And B) I didn't steal your idea,
she did.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.840
Well A) fuck off and
B) yes, I know that now.

29:54.840 --> 30:00.120
Well A) fuck you back and B) you know
this now so originally you told him

30:00.120 --> 30:04.400
that I was the one who nicked the
idea. You are a smart cookie. Yes.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.200
I'm sorry.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.880
Maybe you should dump Peter
and go out with Ollie.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.800
It wouldn't be any more disastrous
than our relationship, would it?

30:11.800 --> 30:15.760
Christ, Ollie! If it's been such
a fucking disaster, why didn't
you break up with me sooner?

30:15.760 --> 30:19.520
Well, if it had been up to me
I would have broken up
with you sooner.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.840
If it had been up...

30:23.840 --> 30:26.080
OK. This is Malcolm, isn't it?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.760
Malcolm has been pimping you out.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.520
You fucking sad...

30:31.520 --> 30:34.120
That's funny.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.120
Fuck you, Phil!

30:34.120 --> 30:37.480
Oh, I'm the bad guy again. Go read
your blog, nerd boy. I'm going.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.520
This is the point when I go.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.880
Wow, that point actually exists?

30:41.880 --> 30:45.640
Incredible. I will be so not sorry
not ever to talk to you again.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.080
You massive floppy, blonde tit.

30:48.080 --> 30:53.200
I hope your blog gets done
for libel and you get
knobbed in prison by men.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.840
It's over

30:54.840 --> 30:58.920
you self-serving
crypto-fascist, horse-loving,

30:58.920 --> 31:04.040
posh, weekend-at-Daddy's,
vacuous nothing.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.280
Fuck you, Ollie,
and put the keys on the side!

31:07.280 --> 31:09.000
He's got keys?

31:09.000 --> 31:13.320
REPORTERS ALL SPEAK AT ONCE

31:13.320 --> 31:19.080
I'm hoping to get a first hand look
at the systemic problems in the
system and how we can sort them out.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.800
What do you think is wrong
with the computer system here?

31:21.800 --> 31:26.040
Well, that's what I hope to find
out this morning. That's the
whole purpose of the exercise.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.880
Have you sorted out
your blog, Mr Mannion?

31:28.880 --> 31:31.240
Your blog? Give me your tie.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.000
We're not wearing it today.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.880
And that actually.

31:34.880 --> 31:38.760
Welcome to immigration.
This is the office, is it?

31:40.520 --> 31:43.800
See, that should have been
our guy up there. No tie.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.440
I love the no-tie.
I like the no-tie thing.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.680
(When everyone went out of the
office, he Googled his name.)

31:51.680 --> 31:53.760
Yeah, that's always fun.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.520
Although I find it quicker just
to poke needles in my eyes. Phil.

31:57.520 --> 32:00.680
Have you seen my blog?

32:00.680 --> 32:04.840
Uh, yeah. I thought you said nobody
reads these things except

32:04.840 --> 32:08.160
political obsessives
and mad Christians in wheelchairs.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.360
Loads of people read mine.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.960
There's a shit load of new abuse

32:12.400 --> 32:15.960
on that feedback thing.

32:15.960 --> 32:21.120
Yeah, you read the thing
about you being a Holocaust denier.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.560
Yeah and the thing about cats.

32:23.560 --> 32:28.680
I think it's technical,
but we may have been
the victims of a link-jacking.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.680
Someone's link-jacking the blog.

32:30.680 --> 32:34.280
"Link-jack?" You so obviously
just made that up.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.800
(He's saying something
about link-jacking.)

32:36.800 --> 32:39.000
Try and put a lid on it.

32:39.000 --> 32:46.840
It's bad enough having to work here
with these fucking zombies
without this. Christ, I need a fag.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.320
So.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.760
How's it going?
First day and all that? They
showed you where to put your pumps?

32:54.760 --> 32:59.000
Good news, we make tomorrow's
papers, gentlemen. Da-da!

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
Oh for God's sake. On the downside,
you appear to be
smoking a cigarette.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.600
On the up side, there's no tie.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.440
So, well done.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.560
Well, good first day. And the blog.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.960
That's blowing up
quite spectacularly, isn't it?

33:13.960 --> 33:17.680
So you little cat rapist you,
what are you going to do about it?

33:17.680 --> 33:22.840
Well, two pronged strategy. Firstly,
I'm across the filter. Whoopedy-do!

33:22.840 --> 33:25.960
And the second, even more
impressive prong, is that Peter

33:25.960 --> 33:29.320
has uncovered some real problems
down at the immigration centre.

33:29.320 --> 33:33.520
There's a crack between databases
which means illegal applicants

33:33.520 --> 33:38.720
from candidate EU nations, even

33:33.520 --> 33:38.720
criminals, are just swarming in,

33:38.720 --> 33:41.720
while genuine applicants
are left hanging.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.640
Let's not use those words.
Illegals and swarming, etc.

33:45.640 --> 33:50.120
We're going to need something
to announce so you might
want to start to think about that.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.680
What, a policy? Not a policy.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.720
That's what I meant, not a policy.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.640
So, what shall I announce?

33:56.640 --> 34:02.920
A patriotic tattoo,
a change of sexual orientation?

34:02.920 --> 34:05.560
We just need a policy flavour,
Peter.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.080
So, why don't you start
thinking about it?

34:08.080 --> 34:13.120
It's just that I have always
been consistently
way ahead of the party on this.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.360
I have always welcomed immigration,
the economic benefits.

34:17.360 --> 34:24.000
It's JB and his Eton clique who are
always texting each other about
"dune coons" and "nip in the air".

34:24.000 --> 34:29.440
Remember him laughing at Frank's
party at the one about the Pakistani

34:24.000 --> 34:29.440
guy being thrown off the train?

34:29.440 --> 34:33.360
Yeah, JB has got
very progressive views.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.080
I think you'll find what he was
doing was ironising, Peter.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.480
Why don't you get out there
and neutralise some negatives, OK?

34:39.480 --> 34:42.880
Vis-a-vis the blog.
The system stinks.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.800
We do not have a go at immigrants.
OK. I love immigrants.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.159
I eat take away, use mini cabs.
I'm down with them.

34:51.679 --> 34:57.200
Well, Stew, if you can mix
the press harping on about

34:51.679 --> 34:57.200
this blog thing, can you do that?

34:57.200 --> 35:00.200
Can you manage that?
I'm already onto that, Peter.

35:00.200 --> 35:04.800
They can probably trace most
of the pooh-slinging back
to Malcolm Tucker's IP address.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.480
Oh, that would be lovely.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.640
So, we're going with that story

35:06.480 --> 35:10.640
tomorrow. Very good. Well, done.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.960
The story's isn't me. Nobody's
interested in me and I would be

35:10.640 --> 35:14.960
pleased if you remember that. OK?

35:14.960 --> 35:17.320
You sure you don't want
Hugh and me to come back?

35:17.320 --> 35:20.160
We could give you some cover.
Hugh's not coming back.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.680
It would look like we're panicking.
But I need you to let them
know we're not panicking.

35:24.680 --> 35:27.360
So you want me to interrupt
my holiday in a panic

35:27.360 --> 35:30.000
so Hugh doesn't interrupt his
holiday and look like he's panicking?

35:30.000 --> 35:34.440
You get back here. I want to see
you popping a bollock for me.

35:34.440 --> 35:37.280
You seen this?

35:37.280 --> 35:42.040
No, I haven't seen that. I'm the
senior press guy for the Government
of Great Britain & Northern Ireland.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.040
No, I don't look at the newspapers,
that's fucking news to me.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.360
All right, all right.
What are we doing? What are we doing?

35:48.360 --> 35:50.000
Fuck all. We're not doing nothing.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.960
Cos I'm not the story here.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.960
You kind of are the story. They
spelt your name right and everything.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.920
Look, we're not doing nothing.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.600
No drawing attention to it.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.360
I'm not drawing attention to it.

36:00.360 --> 36:04.600
You're drawing my attention to it.
Stop looking at it.

36:04.600 --> 36:09.560
All right. We stay frozen to the
fucking floor and send everyone in
the media to Coventry. That'll help.

36:09.560 --> 36:14.840
That will help. That's the way
I want to play it.
I'm going for a walk. A walk? Yeah.

36:14.840 --> 36:21.600
Do I need your permission to go for
a walk? I've never seen you go for

36:14.840 --> 36:21.600
a walk. How do you think I get here?

36:21.600 --> 36:27.640
How do I get from the front door to
here. I fucking walk? You don't
go FOR a walk. I'm away for a walk.

36:40.680 --> 36:44.960
Julius, you should try
the chicken salad.
If I'm lucky you'll get salmonella.

36:44.960 --> 36:49.280
Now that is amusing, Malcolm.
Very funny.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.120
Don't you have a sandwich flunky?

36:51.120 --> 36:54.400
I like to see them myself.
Feel the heft.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.360
Course you fucking got to do that.

36:57.360 --> 37:01.880
Anyway, I see you're in the papers
Malc. I'm not in the papers.
You are in the papers.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.600
I'm not the story here.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.600
People are not interested in me.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.800
The PM has asked me to make
a few key nodes aware
of a change in his thinking.

37:08.800 --> 37:14.240
Oh, yeah of course, you're chief
of the nodes, aren't you? I am

37:08.800 --> 37:14.240
chief node. The node of node hall.

37:14.240 --> 37:18.280
The Peter Mannion coalface thing
has rather made
the PM accelerate his plans.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.840
In what way? He's given me a date.

37:20.840 --> 37:26.960
A surprising date. What is the date?

37:20.840 --> 37:26.960
I can't tell you the date. I need
to know. It is a surprising date.

37:26.960 --> 37:30.040
What the fuck does that mean?
The titty ninth of February?

37:30.040 --> 37:32.320
Flatember 4th. 8BC?

37:32.320 --> 37:37.080
It means it is a surprising date. But
it does also mean the PM is going to

37:37.080 --> 37:41.560
announce the legacy, the independent
immigration service, on Friday.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.880
Friday, three days' time.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.400
So it's six months and three days.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.200
He's going to be gone,
six months, three days, that's...

37:49.200 --> 37:51.680
Don't try and work it out.
I'm not hungry.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.320
I'll see you later, OK.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.600
That is why it's called the £5
present. It's supposed to cost £5.

37:57.600 --> 38:02.040
If you pay more than £5
and it looks like you did,
everybody thinks you're a dick.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.080
They think you're being a bit
flashy about stuff. That's the...

38:06.680 --> 38:09.120
Can I call you back?

38:10.640 --> 38:14.920
Hello.
I've been looking for you, Ollie.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.800
You and me Ollie. Eh?

38:17.800 --> 38:20.640
I've just realised,
we're in the same boat.

38:20.640 --> 38:24.240
Well, obviously, I'm up on
the bridge with the binoculars
and Richard Gere gear

38:24.240 --> 38:28.880
and you're down in the engine room,
trying not to get bum-raped by
a bunch of big lads with shovels.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.880
But essentially, it's the same boat.

38:31.880 --> 38:36.680
What...sorry, what boat are
we discussing? Well, the thing is,

38:36.680 --> 38:39.680
people like you and I,
we need time...

38:41.200 --> 38:46.160
..time to ease the transition from
one regime to the next.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.520
And, I've been hearing
from a very nasty and very baldy

38:50.520 --> 38:57.040
little bird that we might not be
getting the time that we need

38:50.520 --> 38:57.040
to make the alliances we need,

38:57.040 --> 39:01.400
to ease the transition. OK... So...?

39:01.400 --> 39:05.320
So, I want the opposition to
make an announcement for me.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.760
The opposition?

39:07.760 --> 39:14.520
I want them to announce
the hiving off of immigration
to a non-political executive body.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.320
That's the PM's legacy.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.880
But, the opposition,

39:18.880 --> 39:21.760
it's a different party, Malcolm.
I can't make them do things.

39:21.760 --> 39:26.480
Even you can't make them do things.
Where's all the education, where
does it go when it comes to this?

39:26.480 --> 39:29.120
I understand there's this party

39:26.480 --> 39:29.120
and there's this party and we're

39:29.120 --> 39:33.000
this party
and they're this party and
therefore how can I influence that?

39:33.000 --> 39:39.480
You take this and this and put it
onto your bird's breast and you work
them and squeeze them very gently.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.280
You get her into the sack.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.120
You bang her fucking brains out.

39:43.120 --> 39:46.080
You make sure that she comes
and you just give her the policy.

39:46.080 --> 39:51.160
Yeah, but I chucked her and not
in a "it's not you, it's me" way.

39:51.160 --> 39:55.080
More in a "it is you, you hideous
vacuous Sloane bitch from hell".

39:55.080 --> 40:00.000
I'm not interested in your little
tiff. Get round there.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.480
Take your Barry White album and your
lube and your fucking policy folder.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.800
Malcolm, this is
really crossing the line here.

40:05.800 --> 40:10.880
Don't start with the moral
objections, you fucking
Blue Peter badge-wearing ponce.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.160
Go make a contribution
to Amnesty International.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.400
Go buy a goat the whole village can
fuck. But you are doing this for me.

40:17.400 --> 40:22.360
Malcolm! You're bullying me and
I don't know why you're bullying me.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.360
How dare you.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.800
Don't you ever, ever
call me a bully.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.960
I am so much worse than that.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.800
Do it, OK?

40:35.320 --> 40:37.000
Go wash your hands.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.600
Cheers Affers, thanks mate.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.320
What the fuck are you doing here?

40:52.320 --> 40:54.080
The traditional lovers greeting.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.120
I just wanted to pop round
and say, last time,

40:59.120 --> 41:04.160
I...I was hoping we could forget
about last time basically because...

41:05.680 --> 41:11.080
..seriously, can he really not
fuck off? It's like doing
Brief Encounter at the Happy Eater.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.480
Affers, would you mind fucking off?

41:15.320 --> 41:17.360
Thanks darling.

41:17.360 --> 41:21.400
I just don't think we should
fall out over a stupid
stolen policy initiative.

41:21.400 --> 41:25.240
Even if it was quite a serious
breach of the Chinese Wall.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.240
I just feel like...

41:27.240 --> 41:31.640
On the politics, I want to feel like
I can trust you, I can talk openly.

41:31.640 --> 41:37.880
Like I mean, I've got quite a big,
policy initiative and it's
exactly the kind of thing you'd be

41:37.880 --> 41:39.720
interested in,
totally down your street.

41:39.720 --> 41:44.280
I just want to know I can talk about
it in front of you openly, you know.

41:44.280 --> 41:50.440
So Malcolm sent you over
here to leak a policy? No. Yes.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.480
You are really are a very slow
fucker-offer, aren't you?

41:53.480 --> 41:55.600
Is this the only reason
you've come round?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.560
No.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.680
I'm basically here for us.

42:06.640 --> 42:10.600
Would you like
a city break in Venice?

42:10.600 --> 42:12.840
So go on, what's the policy?

42:12.840 --> 42:16.840
It's massive, literally massive.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.440
It's the PM's legacy.

42:22.320 --> 42:27.280
The thing is, I've been working
closely with Ben and, apart
from the fact we might have to

42:27.280 --> 42:30.800
fucking wire his eyes open,
he might just be a bit of a player.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.520
Well, thank you for
this lavish and fulsome praise.

42:33.520 --> 42:38.600
You haven't come dashing back in a
panic then? Not at all. No, no, no.

42:38.600 --> 42:44.440
I soon realised I'd tired of all the
delights of South Wales which
consisted solely, it seemed to me,

42:44.440 --> 42:49.080
of a single shop selling firelighters
and bargain clingfilm. Do I know you?

42:49.080 --> 42:52.160
Don't you work for somebody famous?

42:52.160 --> 42:54.680
Malcolm "Hamish Macdeath"?

42:54.680 --> 42:57.720
It's Peter Onion, isn't it?

42:59.240 --> 43:04.960
That's right.
I always forget. Were you the
forced abortion or the love child?

43:04.960 --> 43:08.480
Or the guy who asphyxiated himself
with a kiwi?

43:11.320 --> 43:13.680
Just the love child.
I was the quiet one.

43:13.680 --> 43:19.680
Like John Deacon in Queen.
Ah, Julius. Haven't seen you

43:13.680 --> 43:19.680
since Carla Powell's.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.280
What are you doing here?

43:21.280 --> 43:23.680
Well, I wanted to have a chat
with you.

43:23.680 --> 43:30.400
I hear on the journalistic
political grapevine nexus

43:23.680 --> 43:30.400
that you're getting your boys to

43:30.400 --> 43:34.000
attend the media centre tomorrow.
Now tell me, what's all that about?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.840
Oh. I couldn't possibly say, Julius.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.880
Oh, come on, Peter. Come on.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.920
Chatham House rules.
I won't say a word.

43:39.920 --> 43:47.160
Well, just between us, off the back
of my visit, float immigration.

43:47.160 --> 43:55.640
Kick the whole political football
out of the policy minefield
and into the electoral goal.

43:55.640 --> 43:58.960
That's a good idea. A good idea.

43:58.960 --> 44:03.600
Nice. Listen, I need to find myself
a maize-based snack.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.360
So you just bear with me one second.

44:06.360 --> 44:09.080
Pat?

44:09.080 --> 44:13.040
Sorry, are you eating? Sorry. I need
you to do something immediately.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.040
Why are you wearing that?
What do you mean?

44:16.040 --> 44:22.360
It's a tie. Goes with the shirt.

44:16.040 --> 44:22.360
We put it in the bin. YOU put it in
the bin. I took it out of the bin.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.440
There is no "we" when it comes
to ties and bins. OK.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.000
It looks very strange.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.800
Well, of course, it looks strange,
it's been in the bin.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.840
Julius Nicholson, what are you
doing out of your Petri dish?

44:32.840 --> 44:35.040
It's a book launch,
not a fucking book burning.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.000
This is a serious code alert. I've
just been talking to Peter Mannion.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.920
Apparently, he's got
a similar policy to the legacy
and he's announcing it tomorrow.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.160
What, it's like the legacy thing?

44:45.160 --> 44:47.240
Well, that's fucking
going to spoil it.

44:47.240 --> 44:51.920
Where did he get that from? No,
it won't spoil it because I've been
on the phone to Pat Morrisey.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.920
We'll bring the PM's announcement
forward to tomorrow, 11am.

44:54.920 --> 44:57.000
Don't say a word. What?

44:57.000 --> 45:00.040
Tomorrow, 11 o'clock.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.040
11 o'clock is not a good time.

45:00.040 --> 45:04.400
If we bring it out early it won't
cause a problem. Who ticked this?

45:00.040 --> 45:04.400
I didn't tick this.

45:04.400 --> 45:09.000
This has happened and I haven't
ticked this. I HAVE got a tick.

45:04.400 --> 45:09.000
I should have been informed.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.720
I have informed you.

45:10.720 --> 45:15.680
There you are, you're being informed.

45:10.720 --> 45:15.680
You haven't informed me. You've
bumped into me in a book launch.

45:15.680 --> 45:20.480
I've not bumped into you. Is this

45:15.680 --> 45:20.480
how we'll run things from now on?
No. "Oh, we'll bomb Sudan."

45:20.480 --> 45:22.840
"Shall I tell
the Chief of Defence staff?"

45:22.840 --> 45:27.160
"Oh, we'll bump into him
at fucking Costa Coffee

45:22.840 --> 45:27.160
at some point." Please listen to me.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.800
Things are moving very fast.

45:28.800 --> 45:33.280
Moving fast.
I'm going to sort this out.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.400
You are fucking useless to me.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.800
Right, you... Ow, Malcolm.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.600
Mannion
is not announcing early enough.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.560
Look, they're the opposition.
They've got their own minds
and they can make them up.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.480
I can't control them,
you can't control them.

45:49.480 --> 45:54.600
You're like some one-man guerrilla
army operating against
your own fucking government.

45:54.600 --> 46:01.560
This is the not the day for you
to be brave with me.
You're not fucking Andy McNab.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.960
Watch my moves.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.600
Right Ben, you're coming with me.

46:05.600 --> 46:08.400
I'm signing books. I don't care
if you're signing books.

46:08.400 --> 46:13.640
Come with me before I stick your

46:08.400 --> 46:13.640
nuts in a book and squeeze till
they come out like pressed flowers.

46:13.640 --> 46:16.920
You Christopher fucking Robin,
you come with me.

46:16.920 --> 46:19.000
I want you to
announce a policy for me.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.120
I want you to take the credit
and be the face of it.
This is an overture?

46:23.120 --> 46:27.400
You're coming round to the "Nutter"
way of thinking?
You're bailing out on the PM?

46:27.400 --> 46:30.560
No, of course not. What's
your policy, what's your idea?

46:30.560 --> 46:34.320
Taking immigration
out of political control.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.480
Hang on, you're giving
this to him now, are you?

46:36.480 --> 46:40.360
I'm going to bang you on Newsnight.
Right? And you are going
to fly this time.

46:40.360 --> 46:46.720
You are going to light up the sky,
where's your phone? Give us
your phone. Oh, not Newsnight.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.080
"How are we going to pay for it?"
They'll ask me that.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.280
Ollie,
where's the money coming from?

46:52.280 --> 46:55.280
Um, we can just cancel something
that's already on the slate maybe?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.440
Oh, brilliant.
I'll say that, that will be great.

46:57.440 --> 47:04.280
Thank you, Carol Vorderman. Why
don't we say that we're wrapping up
the citizenship program with this.

47:04.280 --> 47:07.560
It won't add up but they'll find

47:04.280 --> 47:07.560
it hard to prove, cos we've

47:07.560 --> 47:11.480
never said how much citizenship
costs in the first place.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.440
That'll do.

47:13.440 --> 47:16.400
OK, this is it.

47:16.400 --> 47:22.200
This is it. I've got to think
about it. Don't wave my phone at me.
That's not going to help.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.840
He's doing the blinky thing again.

47:24.840 --> 47:29.880
Right, if you're not going to go on,
I'm going to get this giggling
streak of piss to go onto Newsnight.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.000
I don't even fucking care.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.960
Let it be his chinless, sulky
little face that everyone sees for
the whole of the next week.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.320
OK, fuck it, I'll do it.
Yes, I'll do it.

47:40.320 --> 47:43.840
Yes, you are the man. I am.

47:43.840 --> 47:46.160
Hi Liz, how are you?
Good to talk to you.

47:46.160 --> 47:50.600
Listen, I think you're going
to have to bump your lead.

47:50.600 --> 47:55.920
Yes, I have got Ben Swain
with an exclusive announcement.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.400
It's a very special...

47:55.920 --> 47:58.400
Have I broken into a party?

47:58.400 --> 48:01.080
Have I got permission
from the party committee?

48:01.080 --> 48:03.160
What's happening?
Fucking fantasy football.

48:03.160 --> 48:05.240
What's going on?

48:05.240 --> 48:09.400
I'm going on Newsnight. Good for

48:05.240 --> 48:09.400
you. Tell Paxo to bring it on

48:09.400 --> 48:11.880
because this time he's facing
Russell fucking Crowe.

48:11.880 --> 48:17.600
To discuss the executive,
the immigration executive policy.
You're going to what?

48:17.600 --> 48:20.600
About sourcing or taking away
immigration control
from the Government.

48:20.600 --> 48:24.760
I'm announcing it on Newsnight.
When? Tonight. Tonight?

48:24.760 --> 48:27.600
You're going on Newsnight tonight?

48:27.600 --> 48:30.120
I'll talk to you in a minute.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.040
He didn't tell him, did he?

48:35.040 --> 48:36.880
He did actually tell him. Yes.

48:36.880 --> 48:41.160
OK. Malcolm Tucker, if you'd just
like to tell me
what the f-word is going on?

48:41.160 --> 48:45.560
I thought it would be a good idea
to tee up the legacy, to make
a pre-announcement on Newsnight.

48:45.560 --> 48:49.240
A pre-announcement?
What does that mean?

48:45.560 --> 48:49.240
That doesn't mean anything, Malcolm.

48:49.240 --> 48:52.760
The fact is, it is top secret until
the Prime Minister announces it

48:52.760 --> 48:59.240
or it's massive fly in the departure
programme. OK? Fine. It's not fine...

48:59.240 --> 49:05.480
Great. That's your 15 minutes up.
You should have been a bit
faster off your feet

49:05.480 --> 49:08.240
but don't clearly
mention the policy.

49:08.240 --> 49:11.280
Well, I can't mention...you'll have
to cancel it. You'll have to cancel.

49:11.280 --> 49:19.120
Are you fucking kidding me?
You've just watched me break

49:11.280 --> 49:19.120
my not inconsiderable balls

49:19.120 --> 49:24.040
trying to get you the second spot
on Newsnight and succeeding.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.880
I can't back down.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.840
No, no, you're on, pal.

49:28.840 --> 49:33.200
And it better not be too boring
or too interesting either.

49:33.200 --> 49:35.800
It better not cost too much.

49:35.800 --> 49:38.240
It can't be an old thing, obviously.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.080
And don't make it too new.

49:40.080 --> 49:45.640
And whatever you do, please
try not to embarrass yourself.

49:45.640 --> 49:48.480
Right? Oh, for fuck's sake.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.960
I want to talk to you about this
formally. Yeah. I'm serious.
Four minutes is unacceptable.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.800
Get me a tuna wrap,
fucking sandwich boy.

49:54.800 --> 49:59.200
No, not "get me a tuna wrap". I'm
having a word with the PM about this.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.120
You can fuck off as well, Joe 90.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.440
I blame you for this. A lot.

50:04.440 --> 50:06.920
That's hardly fair, Malcolm.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.880
I've humiliated myself
for you over this.

50:08.880 --> 50:12.600
I'm going to fucking Venice
for you over this.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.440
Get out the door.

50:22.280 --> 50:27.360
Liz, sorry about that. It's me. I
just want to say I'm coming on, OK?

50:27.360 --> 50:30.160
On Newsnight. Me, personally.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.680
Book me in.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.200
Liz?

50:40.200 --> 50:42.920
That was... I was just
getting ahead of myself then.

50:42.920 --> 50:46.440
You've got to understand.
Obviously, I wouldn't come...

50:46.440 --> 50:50.800
It would be wrong for me
to come onto your programme.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.240
You cannot.

50:53.240 --> 50:58.320
Me calling up to say that is not
in itself a story.
You can't run with that.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.800
You cannot fucking run with me,

51:00.800 --> 51:05.280
you can't run with that as a fucking
story, you fucking sour-faced bitch!

51:10.880 --> 51:12.360
Christ!

51:13.760 --> 51:18.520
Sam, not right now, not right now,
OK? Later, right.

51:28.840 --> 51:33.880
No, it's not Ben Swain, it's me.

51:28.840 --> 51:33.880
I'm using his phone because
I knew you wouldn't pick up for me.

51:33.880 --> 51:38.200
Please would you listen to me.
I just want to apologise, OK?

51:33.880 --> 51:38.200
I was a bit abrupt.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.520
A bit of horse play
that got out of hand.

51:40.520 --> 51:45.160
I don't mind, you can tell
anybody you like
that I was having a carry on

51:45.160 --> 51:47.400
because that's not usually
the kind of thing I do.

51:47.400 --> 51:52.960
But, it is, that's over,
all right Liz, do you accept that?

51:52.960 --> 51:55.480
Do...

51:58.960 --> 52:02.840
Right, I want one minute
of your time, Malcolm.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.480
Just thought you'd like to know.

52:05.480 --> 52:11.920
Thanks to the maelstrom of confusion
and the to-ing and the fro-ing
and the chopping and the changing,

52:11.920 --> 52:13.880
the legacy project
has now been ditched.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.600
The Prime Minister
has decided to pull it.

52:16.600 --> 52:21.920
I hope you're happy about that,
Malcolm, I'm sure you are.

52:21.920 --> 52:26.560
You know Julius, if I wasn't a
heterosexual man, I would kiss you.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.800
Right, I've just seen six months
work go up the chimney.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.680
Thank you very much, Malcolm.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.120
Goodnight.
I will make a mental note of it.

52:37.800 --> 52:40.280
The book is a major announcement.

52:40.280 --> 52:44.680
It announces and informs
on a major series of ideas within

52:44.680 --> 52:49.640
British politics although there's
no easy answer to everything.

52:49.640 --> 52:53.520
Difficult questions. It's complex
questions, complex situations.

52:53.520 --> 52:58.400
Quite a good turn out, isn't it?

52:58.400 --> 53:00.440
You've obviously gone with the tie.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.960
Yes.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.960
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

53:02.960 --> 53:05.600
We thought more gravitas.

53:05.600 --> 53:10.440
The guy with the tie.
This is the kind of guy

53:05.600 --> 53:10.440
immigrants can do business with.

53:10.440 --> 53:13.320
A tie is appropriate here.
This is very much a tie situation.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.240
This is a tie-free zone.

53:15.240 --> 53:18.080
EMMA: If you give me the tie.

53:18.080 --> 53:23.280
Do you want my tie off?

53:18.080 --> 53:23.280
No, I want you to tie your tie
very tight, Phil. ..No buttons.

53:23.280 --> 53:28.160
It looks as though he's spent
the night in the cells.
Once more into the breach!

53:30.240 --> 53:31.880
Morning.

53:31.880 --> 53:34.000
So how was Paxo last night?

53:34.000 --> 53:35.720
He didn't look too happy.

53:35.720 --> 53:38.360
I have it on good authority
that he'd happily

53:38.360 --> 53:40.640
chew off my balls
with his own teeth.

53:40.640 --> 53:42.320
Ah. Paxo.

53:42.320 --> 53:45.240
I'll miss him when he has
that massive coronary.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.640
This looks reasonably unappealing.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.360
A large gloat session.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.760
Come on, Julius. Don't be like that.

53:51.760 --> 53:56.320
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
coming at such short notice.

53:56.320 --> 54:00.400
I'm just going to make a summary
of my findings and conclusions

54:00.400 --> 54:04.560
after my work down at the Watford
Immigration and Asylum Centre.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.560
PHONE RINGS

54:04.560 --> 54:09.360
And also a member of my team
can give you a press pack

54:09.360 --> 54:14.160
with more... What's going on?

54:09.360 --> 54:14.160
PHONES RING

54:14.160 --> 54:16.480
What's that?

54:16.480 --> 54:19.400
The PM's fucking resigned.

54:19.400 --> 54:22.240
He was getting off the plane
in Sunderland and he announced it.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.920
Full statement at five but that's it.

54:25.920 --> 54:29.280
He'll act as caretaker for one month.

54:29.280 --> 54:34.360
But he's fucking gone. Goodbye and
thanks for all the varicose veins.

54:34.360 --> 54:39.520
The Prime Minister has resigned.
You're shitting me. No, I'm not
shitting you. Where's the telly?

54:39.520 --> 54:45.400
I don't know, you're in charge
of communications and television

54:39.520 --> 54:45.400
counts as communications.

54:45.400 --> 54:50.040
This is it, phase two, this is
the line for the next 24 hours.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.200
You speak to everyone you know
and you praise him.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.680
You praise him like
he's your dead brother.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.400
Nothing else. I want to hear
praise, praise, praise.

54:57.400 --> 55:00.480
Shit, this fucking television.
Look at the size of it.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.920
Has it
got a scart cable on it or what?

55:02.920 --> 55:05.720
Who can plug it in?

55:05.720 --> 55:08.080
Right.
Jamie, you gotta get onto this.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.640
You fucking dick.
This is all down to you, you know.

55:10.640 --> 55:14.960
Oh, don't be so fucking stupid.
You're a fucking "Nutter".
I'm not a "Nutter".

55:14.960 --> 55:19.400
You are going "Nutter", mate. Yes,
of course you've never fucking
thought about that, have you?

55:19.400 --> 55:24.960
No, I never have because that's
how they get you. Fuck that.
Thinking, logic, reason, talking.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.800
Hello. Hugh, Hugh.

55:26.800 --> 55:31.000
Ah, Glenn. Hi. Listen. I think this
is going to work to your advantage.

55:31.000 --> 55:37.080
Because I know you're not a "Nutter",

55:31.000 --> 55:37.080
but you're not seen as being not
a "Nutter" either. Are you with me?

55:37.080 --> 55:39.680
War Cabinet in here now.
Emma, join us. What shall I do?

55:39.680 --> 55:43.120
Instead of announcing my thing,
shall I praise him on television?

55:43.120 --> 55:45.480
Why don't you wait for
a camera crew to pass through.

55:45.480 --> 55:47.360
I don't think you're
going on the telly, Peter.

55:47.360 --> 55:53.160
You know, as far as the click thing
goes, you really click with
Tom's wife and Fatty's...not wife,

55:53.160 --> 55:56.040
so that particular glass ceiling
has smashed.

55:56.040 --> 55:58.480
Excuse me, whose office is this?

55:58.480 --> 56:02.480
THEY APOLOGISE

55:58.480 --> 56:02.480
This is a private office.

56:04.320 --> 56:07.720
Well, I might as well call myself
on unofficial leave now.

56:07.720 --> 56:10.240
Nothing will happen for the next
three weeks, absolutely zero.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.880
I'm going to book that holiday.

56:11.880 --> 56:15.600
All they'll do is bob about
like Emperor penguins
trying to swap over an egg.

56:15.600 --> 56:19.280
Blown out the fucking water.
Two days in that hell hole.

56:19.280 --> 56:21.120
Two days in that fucking pit.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.600
I could rape a cat now
and I wouldn't get a paragraph.

56:24.600 --> 56:28.960
Work out what the policy
of the Department of Social Affairs
and Citizenship will do next.

56:28.960 --> 56:32.840
I'd love to but I've got an old
man shouting at me. Where's my tie?

56:32.840 --> 56:35.880
Have you got my tie?
Can I have my tie?

56:35.880 --> 56:39.640
Give me my tie for God's sake.
Give me my fucking tie!

56:39.640 --> 56:41.960
I'm sick of all this rubbish.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.200
What happens to me?
What happens to me? He's gone.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.960
Does he lift the phone?
Does he fuck.

56:46.960 --> 56:49.400
You're fucking bums, the lot of you.

56:49.400 --> 56:52.800
Go and fucking sort yourself out.
Where's your pawn, Ben Swain?

56:54.320 --> 56:56.000
Morning all. What a sad day.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.640
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Have you spoken to Hugh?

56:58.640 --> 57:00.360
Yes, I have. What did he say?

57:00.360 --> 57:03.280
Well, you know, well,
he's interested. Interested in?

57:03.280 --> 57:07.560
Well, I can't tell you what he's
interested in. He's a capable man.

57:07.560 --> 57:15.120
It's a very interesting situation
and he is very interested
in being in the situation.

57:15.120 --> 57:17.440
There it goes again. Excuse me.

57:17.440 --> 57:22.800
Just go and sit down somewhere,

57:17.440 --> 57:22.800
Phil. Try not to touch anything.

57:22.800 --> 57:24.360
It's big news.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.080
I don't know how to react.

57:26.080 --> 57:30.800
You don't know how to react?
Why don't you go make some coffee.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.520
Maldives I thought.

57:33.520 --> 57:38.920
How are you? Yeah, I'm good. It's
certainly an interesting moment.

57:38.920 --> 57:42.160
I think interesting has pretty
much been heavily discussed.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.360
Are you interested?

57:44.360 --> 57:45.880
Well, yeah.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.320
I mean...

57:45.880 --> 57:48.320
HE MOUTHS

57:48.320 --> 57:52.000
My first loyalty
obviously is to Hugh. But, er...

57:55.560 --> 58:00.000
I can't believe it.
That was not the date.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.760
You can say that again.

58:02.760 --> 58:07.080
I was given an incorrect date.
The date was either changed

58:07.080 --> 58:11.800
or my original date was not the
actual date. I fucking know that.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.720
I want JB over from Portcullis now.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.480
Someone send a car for him.

58:15.480 --> 58:18.440
Someone send a carpet round for him
but I want JB here now.

58:18.440 --> 58:22.640
I cannot believe he didn't
tell me the fucking date.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.640
That is fucking rude, isn't it?

58:25.640 --> 58:29.040
I think my diaries will make
pretty interesting reading.

58:29.040 --> 58:32.560
The day he tried to sack the chief
examiner of his son's retake marks.

58:32.560 --> 58:35.720
Oh, yes, I think it might make
quite interesting reading actually.

58:38.520 --> 58:42.760
Zudek, it's Peter.

58:42.760 --> 58:47.600
Would it be possible to
get the hot water on again?

58:47.600 --> 58:50.000
No, I don't care what it costs.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.520
Yes, oh, that's bloody marvellous,

58:53.520 --> 58:56.600
that is quite literally
the best news I've had all day.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.200
I'm coming home, running a bath

58:58.200 --> 59:01.400
and I'm sitting in it
till sometime next week.
