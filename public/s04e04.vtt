1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
This programme contains very strong language

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.760
They're quiet bat people. Is she sniffing these pens at night?

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.360
What's going on inside her abandoned barn of a brain?

4
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.120
Tickle wasn't the Queen of people's hearts, he was a twat in a tent.

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.200
Tickle! We drove a man to his death! We are responsible for this!

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.680
Does this look like a bat? No. I should challenge her? Not necessary.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.200
She's going to kick her own head in.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.360
Which will be easy for her because she does yoga.

9
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.120
Sam, Hi, listen, can you do me a favour?

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.360
Buy some flowers for Nicola fucking Murray.

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.880
Yeah, have them delivered to her home this evening with a card

12
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.880
that says "sorry you had to go, but let's face it,

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.280
"you are a fucking waste of skin."

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.400
"Waste of skin," yeah.

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.600
Yeah, Doug, get the cattle gun ready.

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.040
I'm afraid it's gonna be painful, yeah.

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.360
But you know me, I'm always on the look out

18
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.480
for new sources of powerful opiates.

19
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.560
Morning, I'm looking for Mr Oliver Reeder.

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.000
He looks a bit like a Quentin Blake illustration.

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.040
Just down the corridor on the right.

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.840
Very good, Bill, very good.

23
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.680
You weren't funny in London, you're not funny in Salford.

24
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.560
Oh, do I have to do the..? Yes, please. Matron knows best, eh?

25
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.360
I do. I've got a friend who drinks this stuff.

26
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.960
Give him that, and a bag of macadamias

27
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.400
and he's made for the night.

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.120
Hiya, Mum. Yeah, a bit sore.

29
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
Here she is. Britain's latest post-op transsexual.

30
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.160
Do they actually manage to graft one on?

31
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.400
I'll call you back, Mum. It's the scary Morrissey.

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.920
I've come to cheer you up. Did you actually buy me flowers, Malcolm?

33
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.280
It's one of the many advantages

34
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.160
of living close to an accident blackspot.

35
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.920
So how are things, little boy from the Secret Garden?

36
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640
Well, you know, there's no WI-FI,

37
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.280
there's basic Freeview it's like living in 2003.

38
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.120
But I am lighter to

39
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.960
the tune of one whole appendix, so I do feel very svelte.

40
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.000
So have you seen this? Nicola Murray is unelectable?

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520
Fleming is foaming.

42
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.360
Is that it then, is she fucked?

43
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.160
Like Caligula's favourite watermelon.

44
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840
Fleming's fired the starting pistol,

45
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.800
so we can all start firing our actual pistols

46
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.040
onto her fucking fat, unelectable, smug head.

47
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.320
How... Is this it now?

48
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.640
It's on. It's on like fat Pat's thong.

49
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.080
We're putting her on a train

50
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.400
to Bradford. It's the closest as I could get to locking her in a metal box.

51
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.120
Oh, this is the "here to hear" thing.

52
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.840
A great idea, going round the country listening to people

53
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.520
tell you that they hate you, just in different accents.

54
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.880
IN DIFFERENT ACCENTS: "I fucking hate you",

55
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.440
"I hate you," "I fucking hate you,"

56
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.520
so, wait, today's the day? Today's the day.

57
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.280
Once she's on the train, I'm going to detonate the main bomb,

58
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.880
but I need you to set one off later.

59
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.080
Malcolm, I'm in hospital, I'm not, I'm not wearing any pants. I don't care if you've been

60
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.120
dead a year, playing cribbage with Jimmy fucking Saville.

61
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.120
I want you to make a bomb and explode it, today.

62
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.440
This is a metaphorical bomb right?

63
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.960
This is it, Jack fucking Bauer,

64
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.320
time for you to embrace your inner bastard.

65
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.160
I'll be in touch, right. That wee nurse needs cheering up.

66
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.400
Nice, really nice, Malcolm, those are my flowers.

67
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.240
Easy come, easy go.

68
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.280
Is everything OK?

69
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.080
I've had a stroke. Oh, no, no such luck.

70
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.440
Is that why you're not answering your phone? I'm finding it quite comforting.

71
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.240
Maybe I'll bring you a shot glass and some bleach.

72
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.920
Hey, only my kids are allowed

73
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920
to talk to me like that, and my husband.

74
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.000
Don't forget you're on a train to Bradford soon,

75
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.440
Can you try to arrange for me to be underneath it? I look forward to our lovely train journey together.

76
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.160
I look forward to you fucking off actually. Thanks very much.

77
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.920
Is the Dowager Countess receiving? Can you give her a minute?

78
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.320
She's meditating. Step aside, she's asked to see me.

79
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.880
Morning, oh, God, oh, dear.

80
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.080
You can get that in large print you know.

81
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.680
Still not knocking, I see, Malcolm.

82
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160
It's an old habit from my time in the Haitian death squads,

83
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.480
so how you doing? The Guardian seem to hate me

84
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.120
more than the Prime Minister, I mean, what do I expect next,

85
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720
am I gonna get spat at in the street by Michael Palin?

86
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.360
That's highly unlikely, he's really a very, very nice man.

87
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.240
But on to more serious matters, Mr Tickle is dead.

88
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.600
What are you gonna do about it? I'm not going to exploit a suicide.

89
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.480
You can't look a gift corpse in the mouth,

90
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.760
you should be taking it and slapping the government

91
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.880
about the face with it, bit of slap with tickle.

92
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.160
No, I'm not doing it, it's insensitive, as was that.

93
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.480
Sorry, I just think this is what we should be doing.

94
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.880
Look, fine, it's there as a policy we can use in the extreme,

95
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.680
but I just, I just want us to try

96
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.200
and build some momentum through positivity.

97
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.840
OK, yeah, good luck with that.

98
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.360
That's me being positive, by the way.

99
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.080
So, it's just a quick chat with Sky, yeah?

100
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.880
Yeah, just give them ten minutes' bullshit

101
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.680
about how you much prefer them to the BBC,

102
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.120
and then get straight onto the "here to hear" stuff.

103
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.280
It's a very good name "here to hear," well done.

104
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.320
Much better than, what was Olly's effort?

105
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.320
"We're all ears."

106
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.640
But the "all" was capitalised

107
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.400
implying that everyone is actually an ear.

108
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.320
Christ in a hot tub, that is truly terrible.

109
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.320
Olympic sprinters don't get paid for the number of hours they run,

110
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.640
otherwise, if they did,

111
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.480
the faster you ran, the less they'd actually get paid.

112
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.800
Oh, God, Duggan, of all people. John, nice to see you again.

113
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.440
All aboard the Hogwarts express

114
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.400
for Nicola Potter and the Prisoner of AzkerBradford.

115
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.160
I come bearing broadcast journalists.

116
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Sounds almost sexual, doesn't it?

117
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.120
This is Cath-y, Cathy, so good they named her twice.

118
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.760
And a cameraman who's name I cannot recall. I'm Nicholas.

119
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.280
Hello, hi. Nicola Murray.

120
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.520
This is Helen, my number two.

121
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.480
Ah, unexpected item in bagging area.

122
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.240
I was expecting something more Olly shaped, I'm JD, recently divorced.

123
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.000
Erm, John, maybe...

124
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.960
Please call me JD, I've rebranded.

125
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.400
Right, so John, if you could get us some drinks, that would be great.

126
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.200
Absodutely, I could murder a lager. It's all right drinking on trains, isn't it?

127
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.720
It's one of those places where alcohol is acceptable

128
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.800
at any time of day, like a casino or Cardiff.

129
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.000
That's not racist. I could have said Glasgow or Dublin.

130
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.320
Glenn, mate, guess who?

131
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.120
No, it's Olly Reeder. Who the fuck's Preston?

132
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.920
No, all right, listen, I was wondering if you fancied a spot of lunch?

133
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.960
You know St Thomas' Hospital? Well, let's say St Thomas' Hospital.

134
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.120
Because I'm in St Thomas' Hospital, Glenn.

135
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.400
Yeah, it's a Nigella recipe, you, you,

136
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.760
you sort of do it with gammon and Coca Cola, it's fantastic.

137
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.320
Ah, the hairless Hagrid? I need a private word. We're in the middle of something.

138
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.840
I need you lot to make like a tree, and go fuck yourselves.

139
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.280
Yeah, we'll, we'll pick this up later.

140
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.720
You know, Westminster can often seem to be all about here, here.

141
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.760
But we want to make it clear that with "here to hear,"

142
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.080
we are very definitely here to hear.

143
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.000
So, today, in Bradford,

144
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.680
we're going to be talking to the good folk of that city,

145
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.520
that we're there for them, that we are listening

146
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.880
to their concerns and that we're there to, erm,

147
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.240
that we're here to hear.

148
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.560
Great, well. That OK? I think that's us done. Good, good, lovely.

149
00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.160
Thanks. Thank you. Oh, are you, that's where you're erm...

150
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.360
We'll be grabbing some GVs and some day in the life shots.

151
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.160
Just some shots of you pretending to work, pretty sure I mentioned it.

152
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.440
You absolutely, definitely didn't mention it, John,

153
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.840
but that's, yeah, great, nice to spend a bit more time...

154
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.320
Maybe not, in my defence, I am the busiest man in politics.

155
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.520
One of the three main reasons my marriage broke up.

156
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.840
She was a Muggle, next wife's got to be a politico.

157
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.560
I'm sorry I can come back,

158
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.440
I didn't realise you were so fucking busy.

159
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.160
Well, I could do some work but you know what, we're still going to lose.

160
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.680
Don't be so grim, you big quim. You are the future of this party, yeah, you are the next generation.

161
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.320
And you're in its past. I mean, I don't really know why you're still here, Malcolm.

162
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.000
I want to see this turn around. I can't leave while we're getting fucked in the polls,

163
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.160
and we're getting fucked consistently and repeatedly like a horse in the fucking Hebrides.

164
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.480
Very original observations, Malcolm MacIntucker,

165
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.480
but what's the solution? Nicola has to go. Today.

166
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.040
Oh, right. You need to resign.

167
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.320
And challenge her for the leadership?

168
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.720
That, no, no. That would be petty and self-interested.

169
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.360
No, you are doing this for the greater good of the party.

170
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.160
As Deputy Leader, Dan Miller will take over, and he can be anointed at a later date.

171
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.640
You want me to stick my cock in a fan

172
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.000
so that Dan Miller can become the next Prime Minister!

173
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.280
Fuck you very much, Malcolm.

174
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.440
What do I get out of this?

175
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.360
I would not ask you to do this for nothing, would I?

176
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.640
You might.

177
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.560
I'm asking you, because you're a big fucking beast.

178
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.760
Which is why, when you come back,

179
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.320
it'll be as Foreign Secretary.

180
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.320
You mean Foreign Secretary, that isn't code for Northern Ireland,

181
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.680
I'm not fucking going there.

182
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.520
This is the proper Foreign Secretary with all the perks,

183
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.280
fuck off breakfasts at Dubai hotels, tours of secret Russian sex shops.

184
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.760
All right, all right, I'll do it. And you know what?

185
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.880
I'd have done it for a lot less. I beg your pardon?

186
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.840
I'd have done it just to see the look on Nicola's face.

187
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.640
I've underestimated you.

188
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.080
You've been out manoeuvred by a player. It happens.

189
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.960
Yeah, well, didn't used to.

190
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.840
God, this is absolutely ridiculous.

191
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.920
We so should have sat separately in first.

192
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.000
We can't do first class, it's career suicide,

193
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.760
you might as well do a shit in the aisle.

194
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.200
SMS ALERT

195
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.920
I want you to stay smiling looking relaxed.

196
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.920
Ben Swain is resigning.

197
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.920
Shitting quitting.

198
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.120
Fuck off! Shut up!

199
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.680
What is it sex scandal? I bet he pays for it.

200
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.040
Is he a Gaylord or something?

201
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.960
Grainne thinks it might be a putsch.

202
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.960
That's very good news actually, isn't it?

203
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.720
Just had some independent polling results in.

204
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.520
That's really encouraging.

205
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.680
If you could try and get a breakdown of that,

206
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.960
with a bit more detail that would be... Sure.

207
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.720
..terrific.

208
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.480
I think I might go and get a wrap. Does anyone want anything?

209
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.280
No, thanks. I quite fancy one of those pizzas

210
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.360
that's so hot the cheese actually evaporates.

211
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.200
Right, John, can you...

212
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.000
Sorry I thought, are you not going to fasttrack now?

213
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.840
Yeah, I am. All right, I'll get you a fucking pizza.

214
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.760
She is bonkers.

215
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.360
I, erm, might also go for a celebratory,

216
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.000
er, polling wee. That's what I'm going to do, so, John,

217
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.160
do you want to keep these good people company

218
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.920
without being too "Duggan" about it?

219
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.720
Totes, consider it done. Or about to be done, pre-done.

220
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.400
I'm saying yes, is the gist, basically.

221
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.840
Hello, hi.

222
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.280
Do you want me to do a ring round? Call Olly. Why?

223
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.640
Olly and Ben are mates. I'm sorry I have to keep walking,

224
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.320
this train feels like it's getting very small right now. It's not it's the same size.

225
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.560
Get Olly to call Ben and tell him to offer him anything he wants,

226
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.680
anything at all, bigger portfolio, pig roast, whatever, I...

227
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.960
I've just got to keep moving, I have to keep moving.

228
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.640
So go on then, how's life in Nazi HQ,

229
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.680
is it fun collaborating?

230
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.480
Oh, don't start all that again, I got into government by accident.

231
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.480
Speaking of which, how is Terri?

232
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.400
She's entering her dog for Britain's Got Talent.

233
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.000
What's the matter with you?

234
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.520
Please tell me you're looking for a bone marrow donor

235
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.880
and that I'm you're only hope.

236
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.520
The answer would be "no," by the way.

237
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.760
Bad luck, no, it's an appendix out.

238
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.680
I hope it is, since your lot took over the NHS

239
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.320
everything's a fucking adventure.

240
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.280
Look, this is all incredibly entertaining

241
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.240
but you've called me over in my lunch hour

242
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.680
and as you're fond of saying, I don't have many left.

243
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.400
So, you know all this stuff with Mr Tickle. Sad business.

244
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.680
Very sad business. Yeah. Mr Sad is actually very, very sad about it.

245
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.320
Yes, Mr Happy on the other hand, fucking delighted.

246
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.880
Mr Stoic's taking it on the chin.

247
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.920
Yes, Mr Milk-it says we should probably stop this now.

248
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.400
Okey-doke. I need you to dig out an old email for me.

249
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.000
One of those confidential, "delete after reading" emails,

250
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.160
that we never did delete?

251
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.000
Remember the email that Nicola sent ages ago,

252
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.920
where she floated the exact same policy

253
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.080
that's just got Mannion tickled in a bad way?

254
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.440
No. No, because you're 90, but, trust me, it does exist.

255
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.000
She was completely up for it before she realised that her

256
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.280
husband's PFI contracts fucked the whole thing.

257
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.880
That, my friend, is the email I'd like you to dig out.

258
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.840
So what's going on here, are you starting...

259
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.600
Is Malcolm starting a coup?

260
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.080
A bit louder, because there's a man in a coma over there,

261
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.720
Glenn, who didn't quite hear that.

262
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.160
Right, wee mission accomplished.

263
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.200
Actually, having an accurate wee into a moving train toilet

264
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.760
would make a great round on The Cube with Philip Schofield.

265
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.760
Nicola, is it true there's a rumour that Ben Swain is going to resign?

266
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.720
No, that's not true. I mean it might be true that there's a rumour,

267
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.960
but that rumour is not true.

268
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.240
So Ben Swain is completely on side? Oh, look,

269
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.320
I think Helen in the vestibule, Nicola.

270
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.960
She wants to, erm, wants to talk to you about your wrap.

271
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.560
In terms of filling, chicken or, or cheese.

272
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.840
That's what her body language is telling me. Any how.

273
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.600
Right. That's probably the first time I've ever used

274
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.240
the words "wrap" and "vestibule" in the same sentence,

275
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.920
actually I'm almost certain it is.

277
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.960
Do you need to get that?

278
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.240
Erm, no, but I do need a wee, so... All right, take it easy,

279
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.680
let me give you a hand. Don't! I'm sorry. Not there! All right.

280
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.200
That's where the appendix usually goes.

Ben's threatening to resign. Ben?

286
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.760
Nah, he's just a fucking air bag.

287
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.840
I know he's a fucking air bag,

288
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.560
but if he goes off now in Nicola's face,

289
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.560
she'll crash, so you've gotta call and stop him, OK? We...

290
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.800
And you've hung up.

291
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.880
Wow, I'm fine, thanks, for asking, Wednesday fucking Addams.

Olly, this is the shittiest lunch break

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.000
I've had since Stewart took us all out for sushi.

294
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.040
Patience, old man, and you can watch the fuck puppet master at work now.

I don't really have time for chit chat, Olly.

300
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.160
Are you resigning, mate? Are you dropping the R-bomb? Benola Gay?

301
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.320
And I'm not just talking about the rumours.

302
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.920
Let's just say it is time to prepare the hidey hole

for Madame Hussein, her reign of error is over.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.680
And out of interest, Ben, what would it take to stop you from resigning?

305
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.080
'Why, what's Nicola offering?' Name your price.

306
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.760
All right, Shadow Chancellor.

This is a fucking joke. Ben Swain, Chancellor.

He goes into debt every time he passes a sweet shop.

Let's pass it on to the new Glenn. She's about to lose her job,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.560
so she's more like the old Glenn.

314
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.760
Yes.

315
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.080
'He would like Chancellor.'

316
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.480
He wants Chancellor.

317
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.840
Just give it to the fucker. It's fine.

318
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.240
What? Are you jerking my turkey? Chancellor?

319
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.200
It's a panicky thumbs up, from the vestibule.

320
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.920
Shit a thimble. Right, well.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.120
'Shadow Chancellor Swain.'

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.840
You are kidding me! Deal or no deal?

323
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.160
I'll take the red box containing the fucking red box,

324
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.640
thank you, Noel, Ah, that is amazeballs.

325
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.680
Ha! Ben Swain, knocks it out the park. I'm off.

330
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.960
'he's not resigning.'

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.360
Christ in a diamond heist, the dopey fucking bollard.

332
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.960
Right, how are you getting on with the old man from Up?

333
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.440
Yeah, you know, getting there. 'Well get a move on.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.200
'I want him leaking like Cliff Richard out jogging.'

336
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.680
Er, OK, Anne to justice, Sanjay to energy and climate change,

337
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.920
and Cuntface to culture media and sport.

338
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.840
Er, so C-face to CMS.

339
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.520
Er, Doug to Scotland, and Frank to international.

340
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.480
Frank to international development. It works, we don't need Ben.

341
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.280
Fuck Ben. Fuck Ben. Brilliant, give me some skin,

342
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.960
palm, I dunno. Sorry.

343
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.960
I wasn't expecting to have to up my offer.

344
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.440
But that's how a gazumping works, Dan.

345
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.160
Er, what if I were to offer you Deputy Leader of the party?

346
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.880
I would consider it. Would you?

347
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.440
I would consider it briefly, and then say "no." I see.

348
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.720
Oh, here she is, Pippa Middleton, trying to steal the limelight

349
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.720
with your peachy little arse.

350
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.600
Right, where are we?

351
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.960
I've just offered Ben deputy leadership of the party.

352
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.520
I don't want it. I want Chancellor.

353
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.360
Chancellor? Of the United Kingdom?

354
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.760
It's what Nicola's offering me.

355
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.240
Are you sure about this Ben? How's your economics? Good, strong.

356
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.080
What you're a PPE guy? No, History of Art, but...

357
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.080
You are confident that one day you'll be able to shepherd the country

358
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.760
out of one of the darkest economic periods in its entire fucking art history.

359
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.760
Look, at the moment, I hold all the cards,

360
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.640
including the card that tells you how to play so, so it's over.

361
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.520
The fat lady's singing. No, she's not.

362
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.560
The fat man from the Go Compare advert is talking.

363
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.040
This is tiger by the tail time,

364
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.000
and I am loving it, loving it, loving it.

365
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.840
In that case you leave me no option, Ben,

366
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.040
I'm gonna have to say "yes."

367
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.880
Ha, ha, Chumba-fucking-Wumba.

368
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.120
Then I resign on the dotted line.

369
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.040
Can you give us a minute, Ben, please?

370
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.920
Dan and I need to talk some strategy.

371
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.280
Might head in the direction of confection. Any snackage, anyone?

372
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.320
No, no.

373
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.560
Is this for real?

374
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.360
No, of course it's not for real, Malcolm.

375
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.840
I'm offering him Chancellor,

376
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.840
I may as well offer bass player in The Wurzels,

377
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.960
because that burley haemorrhoid's not in any fucking Cabinet of mine.

378
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.320
Good. So how you gonna shaft him? That's not my problem.

379
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.280
That's your problem, Malcolm.

380
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.920
Right, so this is a little test? You're weighing my balls?

381
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.720
Should we get Ben?

382
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.480
Oh, he'll be back. Like the shit Terminator.

383
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.200
There he is.

384
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.440
Ben Swain. I know, she's a crazy woman. Nicola's got to go.

385
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.560
Any time a decision has to be made on anything

386
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.880
she just starts flapping about like Christ in a crucifix shop.

387
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.200
She's a nightmare.

388
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.840
She backed the hospital flats sell off, a man is dead because of that policy.

389
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.680
Oh wind it up, Polly fucking Toynbee.

390
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.480
All right fine, think of it this way.

391
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.360
Do it for yourself then, Glenn. Do it for the sheer revenge.

392
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.200
What has it actually been like, hey?

393
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.760
The last two years stuck in that fucking office

394
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.520
being pulled out once a week for a poke and a mop,

395
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.480
like some kind of fucking dancing bear.

396
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.320
What's that actually been like?

397
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.320
Absolutely relentless.

398
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.720
The worst thing is, there's no humour in the cruelty.

399
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.720
And you could never have said that about me.

400
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.800
So, do it for yourself and for the party.

401
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.960
But I need to have that email.

402
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.400
If you just shut up...

403
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.200
..I'll do it.

404
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.720
You are a diamond, Glenn, not just any form of ancient carbon,

405
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.800
the best. A diamond.

406
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.680
Do I send it to Malcolm or you? Organ grinder or monkey?

407
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.200
I'm no monkey, not any more. Things have changed there, right?

408
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.400
But, yeah, send it to Malcolm. And CC me, no BCC me.

409
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.040
Bcc you? Yeah.

410
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.840
I can't find Benjamin Glutton anywhere.

411
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.680
The massive fuck's gone to ground somehow and nobody's felt the aftershocks.

412
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.040
It's fine, we've sorted it, we've averted Benaggedon.

413
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.720
No, no, I know about the deal, but he's still resigning. Are you sure?

414
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.320
Commander Duggan, reporting for duty, what can I sort?

415
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.640
Go away, stop molesting us.

416
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.800
Oh, Glenn, you wrinkled beauty. This is an emergency situation, Nicola,

417
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.440
you have to break the glass and hit the dead Tickle button.

418
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.760
No, I don't want to do that. What don't you want to do?

419
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.880
Bash the Tickle button.

420
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.520
You need to talk to Sky, call for an inquiry, now.

421
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.160
I really think this could massively backfire.

422
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.000
Is this Tickle? That could be good. I cannot talk when I'm talking.

423
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.560
You're on the ropes, Nicola, do something fucking drastic.

424
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.160
I don't even know how to refer to him! Do I call him Mr Tickle?

425
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.240
I can't call him Mr Tickle. You're stuck on a train.

426
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.240
I fucking know I'm stuck on a train. Just attack, attack, and do it

427
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.760
before Ben's resignation gets out. Fine, yes.

428
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.280
Fine, fine, good. Thank you, Malcolm. Fuck off.

429
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.840
Sky lady, you need to go now, get her immediately.

430
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.760
I'll just, I need a... Just take a moment. Yes, just go.

431
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.760
Ah, Suzy, might shake it up, spray it round the room like a...

432
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.480
Obviously I won't.

433
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.360
You can't have champagne in here.

434
00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.320
You're not fucking pregnant. It's just Prosecco. Just get on with it.

435
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.880
I hereby tweet, I have resigned. More to follow.

436
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.560
Didn't seem that momentous. How many followers have you got?

437
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.240
612, or thereabouts.

438
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.120
Christ, let's hope it gets re-tweeted,

439
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.720
otherwise you might just as well

440
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.440
just whisper it to a fucking dead tramp.

441
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.000
The word I would use Cathy is "disgraceful."

442
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
You know, I think this government has behaved appallingly

443
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.960
in the tragic case of this nurse that has died.

444
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.800
And the tragic events that lead to the death of Mr, er,

445
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.280
a missed and valued member of society,

446
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.200
are now going to have to come under scrutiny.

447
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.040
Great, thank you, Nicola.

448
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.200
We've just had word that Ben Swain is thinking...

449
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.000
Thank you. Nicola has to take a very urgent call, thank you so much.

450
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.920
I have to get off this train, I'm hyper fucking ventilating.

451
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.480
I'll get the door. And leave Duggan where he is, because he's just flotsam now.

452
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.680
Not flotsam, er jetsam, the other one, jetsam.

453
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.000
I'm pretty certain that was a genuinely urgent call.

454
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.040
I'm sure she'll be back to say a few words about Ben Swain.

455
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.120
Four letter ones?

456
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.480
Funny.

457
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.120
No, she hardly swears at all actually, the occasional "shit."

458
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.840
I'm gonna kill Ben Swain, I'm gonna fucking, fucking kill Ben Swain.

459
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.960
I'm gonna get some fucking giant Yorkie, and ram it down his gizzard.

460
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.520
OK, better? Are we there? It's good to let it out, I think.

461
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.960
Once I get out in the air... We're gonna do a ring round.

462
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.160
I'm going to leave Mary to you, she's a bit HRT-ish.

463
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.520
Go, go, go.

464
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.400
Kate, hi, can I count on your support?

465
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.000
Sorry, I am a bit out of breath

466
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.440
it's just because just because I'm running up a ramp.

467
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.800
No, no, not with a view to jumping off.

468
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.200
That's brilliant, that's great news. Thank you.

469
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.640
Hello, Bill.

470
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.280
Is it safe to assume we can count on your support then, love?

471
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.400
OK, that's fantastic, I knew I could trust you.

472
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.200
Lazy fucking shyster.

473
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.400
Mary, I was really hoping I could count on your support.

474
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.360
Well, I'm disappointed to hear you say that, I must say,

475
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.000
because If I'm honest, Mary, you sort of

476
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.440
brought some of this on yourself, really.

477
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.920
Well, in that you had quite a lot of time off before being diagnosed.

478
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.000
All right, Mary. Thank you, bye.

479
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.520
Fucking fibroid polyp bitch.

480
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.360
I hope they sprout out of her abdomen and fucking choke her.

481
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.800
We can still do it.

482
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.360
Do you want a bit of lippy or something?

483
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.520
Do I need it? Yeah.

484
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.360
OK, Ben, Big Ben tells us that it's resignation time. Are you pumped?

485
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.080
Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped to the fucking max.

486
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.080
If I was a petrol pump I'd be making that clicking sound.

487
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.240
Oh, Olly, you foxy lady.

488
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.720
The press have been hoofing an email about that proves

489
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.920
Nicola agreed with this key worker housing scheme.

490
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.560
Sweet. Suzy, can I get some powder?

491
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.320
Oh, Glenn, my trusty crusty. I've just had my boney buttocks saved.

492
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.040
These phones are amazing, aren't they? I've got an application

493
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.120
that can throw grenades into people's dreams.

494
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.080
So, how do I look?

495
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.000
Has that suit got a reinforced trouser arse on it? Ha-ha, very funny,

496
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.960
what, a joke that I'm going to shit myself?

497
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.040
No, you're going to need it for the ten years

498
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.440
you'll be on the back benches. The email trail about the key worker housing shows

499
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.240
that you, Benjamin Trevor Swain

500
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.520
were gleefully in favour of it, just like Nicola.

501
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.240
You... erm...

502
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.800
There you go. Break a leg, love.

503
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.960
And your neck and your wrist, it doesn't really matter.

504
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.800
I never act on impulse, I'm so not impulsive

505
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.480
and Malcolm made me do it and now, fuck.

506
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.600
What?

507
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.920
Launching this inquiry may prove to be misguided in that

508
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:47.600
I now recall I may have fleetingly supported the policy myself.

509
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.640
So you've essentially launched an investigation into yourself?

510
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.720
Malcolm made me do it. Oh, well, Malcolm, yeah.

511
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.960
You've met Malcolm.

512
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.600
I would have said that it was ethically bad, I'm sure. I said...

513
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.320
I'll tell you what you said, just give me a minute.

514
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.480
Brilliant, courtesy of the Telegraph website you said,

515
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.880
"Great revenue raiser but I'm afraid it's a no-no

516
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.520
"because of my bloody husband."

517
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.440
I'm sorry, why would you do that?

518
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.320
You remember all your emails, do you?

519
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.640
That you sent three years ago?

520
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.160
From what I understand from Olly, a large number were sent

521
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.280
to that married producer on the Daily Politics.

522
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.720
Olly is a fucking...because...

523
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.600
He was supposed to leave her and...

524
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.040
OK, while we're on our way back to London maybe

525
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.400
we should make a list of the things, you know, you're for and against.

526
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.840
Let's start with something simple. Animals in circuses? Tell you what,

527
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.920
why don't you make the little list

528
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.400
and shove it up your tight cold arse.

529
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.880
I just need to stare.

530
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.280
Have a good stare.

531
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.440
I believe that this government should be attacked

532
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.480
for its involvement in the tragic death of Mr Tickel.

533
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.280
But I do not believe that Nicola Murray is fit to lead such an attack

534
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.840
because email evidence has clearly shown that she herself,

535
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.680
when a minister, supported the exact same proposals.

536
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.560
Er, as for a brief and regrettable period of time did I.

537
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:14.680
And so it turns out I will not be seeking a front bench position in the foreseeable future.

538
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.480
Dan. Yeah, Blinkey's gone.

539
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.920
Yeah, don't ask how I did it, but I'm on my way over.

540
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.520
Get some sexy underwear on. Wear a basque.

541
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.520
Are you backing Dan Miller for the leadership? I can't reply to those questions at the moment.

542
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.680
PHONE RINGS

543
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.680
Hello.

544
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.640
Olly, how the shit has this happened?

545
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.080
Ben's gone and I'm about to.

546
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.480
Er, I'm sorry about that.

547
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.160
You're not going to try and talk me down off a ledge, are you cos I'm really tired

548
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.280
and the pavement looks like a nice, warm, splatty bed right now.

549
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.120
Nicola, if you fight this, it's just going to be one of those long slow

550
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.440
agonising deaths.

551
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.080
'I might still recover though.'

552
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.200
I mean, maybe you should come on board a bit more,

553
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.520
maybe be my number one?

554
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.240
Sorry, it's career cancer, I would say, terminal.

555
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.640
I'm sorry Nicola, this is it.

556
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.400
Is it?

557
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.600
Right.

558
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.440
I am sorry.

559
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.880
I really thought I could be Prime Minister.

560
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.080
Did you? Yes, didn't you?

561
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.200
Yes. Of course.

562
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.120
Against a parade of top-hatted turds, how could I not win?

563
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.960
I don't know.

564
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.160
Can you ring James actually?

565
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.400
Because he'll just be all smug on the phone and then

566
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.240
I'm gonna end up asking for a divorce and that's exactly what he fucking well wants me to do

567
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.880
and I just know I'm going to end up with the fucking kids.

568
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.560
Right, come on, folks, gather round. Grab your cheesy nachos and your fucking vuvuzelas,

569
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.520
this is what we've been waiting for, it's the queen's fucking speech.

570
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.640
Hello, everybody.

571
00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.440
Thank you very much for coming here at such short notice,

572
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.280
I will be reading a short prepared statement.

573
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.920
Come on, this is history in the making.

574
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.480
This is the ending of a chapter of a very thin book that nobody enjoyed reading.

575
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.720
It has become apparent to me that I no longer have the full support

576
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.040
of my party. You never had the support of the party, you big bag of fucking useless doubt.

577
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.680
'It is for this reason

578
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.400
'and with a heavy heart that I have decided to stand down as leader.'

579
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.480
Sam, get me Fatty on the phone.

580
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.680
Tell him he's won a hamper.

581
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.040
He needs to know the line and tow the line.

582
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.360
You. Bland fucking robot droid, clear that shit out of there.

583
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.520
We need to get a draft in here to blow away

584
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.200
the stench of fucking failure.

585
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.000
Somebody get me a fucking Fanta!

586
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.520
'The only thing I love more than my party is my family

587
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.240
'and I look forward to spending more time with my husband James

588
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.360
'and with my children Ben, Katie...'

589
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.440
And here he is, the anointed one.

590
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.480
Oh, please, please I'm not Christ. He was quite a scruffy man.

591
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.840
I think Nicola's just finishing herself off here.

592
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.680
Thank you very much. Thank you.

593
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.880
(Nicola, Nicola this way this way.)

594
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.800
Oh shit.

595
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.880
Oh, God, here we go.

596
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.320
Do you feel you've been stabbed in the back, Mrs Murray?

597
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.160
She won't be answering any questions at this time, thank you.

598
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.360
Will you be backing Dan Miller?

599
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.600
Can you hear that sound?

600
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.840
Underneath the champagne corks popping, there's another sound.

601
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.280
The sound of the government's arses

602
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.400
yawning open.

603
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.800
Because we have got ourselves a superb leader-in-waiting.

604
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.240
Who's going to stick the boot into those coked-up

605
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.320
cousin-fucking chinless aliens.

606
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.760
CLAPPING

607
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.920
Thank you very much. We have got some work to do with you.

608
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.440
What will you be doing this evening?

609
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.160
'Will it be Dan Miller?'

610
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.920
'Thank you all very much.'

611
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.200
'Any regrets in the last two years?'

612
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.640
Do you have a legacy?

613
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.040
Worst leader in living memory?

614
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.480
Get hold of Claire Ballentine by the ears, if necessary.

615
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.520
Tell her she's on the World Tonight tonight.

616
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.920
Nicola's security pass. Get it altered.

617
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.680
She gets into the lobby and the canteen. And that's it.
