WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.280
This programme contains very strong language from the start and adult humour.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.360
We're on dual commentary. Yeah, like the tennis.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.080
Yeah, sadly without Boris Becker.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.480
I'm surprised Sue Barker doesn't sink her teeth into his thighs, aren't you?

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.920
OK, team, we need to get it out there that the police arrest backlog

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.240
is not a DoSAC FUBAR, OK?

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.240
The Home Office cut paperwork, there are more bobbies on the beat.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.720
No-one to process them at the stations.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.040
I doubt there are any major criminals on the loose, this is about paperwork,

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.440
it's not Con Air! I mean, I wish it was!

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.320
That to Peter. Oh, good morning, Minister!

12
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.400
How did it go with the DPM?

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.840
Oh, so that good. I've got to go.

14
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.160
Anyone read Wolf Hall?

15
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.520
I'm just shuttling messages between them.

16
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.320
I'm like a blue-bottomed fly, frankly. Ah! From Fergus.

17
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.080
It's the one set on a plane.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.000
No, that's Snakes on a Plane.

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This one is Nicolas Cage on a plane.

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.520
Heaven's sake!

21
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.320
Look, Phil,

22
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.560
every petty criminal in the country is in a holding pattern because...

23
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.240
that barrel of cocks at the Home Office can't process

24
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.480
their arrests quick enough, so why am I the one

25
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.800
who has to gimp himself out all day to Martha Kearney and Eddie Mair?

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.720
Since the inquiry DoSAC looks toxic and weak. They're trying to pile

27
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.120
all the Government's ills on us. Whose fault's that?

28
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.320
I said I'm sorry about the inquiry, OK?

29
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.680
I started writing you a letter but it seemed pretentious. If it's consolation,

30
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.160
I haven't felt that humiliated since my trunks fell down at a swimming gala.

31
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.680
It's of no consolation to think of you naked in front of 500 boys.

32
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.160
Yeah, absolutely, Trevor. OK, yeah, drinks soon.

33
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.000
Yeah, you too. OK, bye.

34
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.800
Oh, God!

35
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.400
I just felt my ovaries cringe!

36
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.720
I'm trying to flirt our way out of this police backlog.

37
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.880
Peter, quick reminder, Think Socially,

38
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.320
the social enterprise scheme, we're launching it tomorrow. Sod that!

39
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800
I need to keep a low profile, give it to Fergus and Adam.

40
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.440
Sorry, Han, can I just put you on pause there?

41
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.080
I'm in the minister's office. Oh, great! Oh, no, the proper one!

42
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.040
I'm just pausing you there. Mary Drake.

43
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.920
From the Home Office, she's going to come over, fancies a chat.

44
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.240
But I told old Iron Blouse that I'd talk to her presently!

45
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.840
What part of that sentence doesn't she understand? Just thought you'd like to know.

46
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.560
Don't want to be accused of being a barricade or anything!

47
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.840
ALL: Blockage.

48
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080
Look, things were said at that inquiry, Terri...

49
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.160
They certainly were.

50
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.200
Well, can you just be a fucking professional and get Fergus in here?

51
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440
I am an F-wording professional.

52
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440
Wait, wait, Terri, can you give this to Fergus,

53
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.120
and tell him he's going to front Think Socially tomorrow?

54
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520
Ah. Yeah, OK, err, um, Peter, may I just... No, you may not.

55
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.880
I thought we weren't talking to the Proclaimers.

56
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.560
We have to play happy families for Mary, pretend I don't want

57
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.360
to strangle Fergus's bollocks so they look like glace cherries.

58
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.680
Sorry. Can I?

59
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.640
Christ, you just can't flush her. Can I borrow her?

60
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.080
Yeah, but there's a fine if you don't bring her back.

61
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.880
It should be a fine if you DO bring her back.

62
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.840
Ever since this inquiry, Mannion and Fergus,

63
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.160
their communication has totally broken down. Yes.

64
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.440
Which is why we have the double stamp system. Yeah...

65
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.600
No decisions without a dual approval, what?

66
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.680
Occasionally, just because of a, well...

67
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.800
a time-sensitive decision, I have got a stamp from Peter,

68
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.480
but unfortunately been unable to locate Fergus.

69
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.960
OK, let's fast-forward to the bit where I don't want to eat my own lips off.

70
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.040
In order to prevent a Fergal paper jam,

71
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.720
I have stamped certain decisions

72
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.760
based on what I imagined he might think.

73
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.520
So, you have approved a policy that Fergus is going to launch,

74
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.000
that Fergus knows nothing about?

75
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800
Sort of. Sort of, or sort of exactly?

76
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.760
Sort of exactly.

77
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.160
You're telling me that you have been running parts of this country?

78
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.200
What the fuck are you trying to do, prove the Mayans right?

79
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.240
Ha-ha! "Dear Jim, please could you fix it for me for two departments

80
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.960
"to fuck up on the same day?" "Yes, I can!"

81
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.000
So, this government arrest backlog is a really lovely gift token...

82
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.480
Mmm. The question is, what does Daddy buy with it?

83
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.080
Err, you, the daddy man, err, you could...

84
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.320
how about you point up the split between the HO and DoSAC?

85
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.080
Take the sort of, a "government divided" route. Nice.

86
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.600
Meanwhile, an unarrested feral underclass has gone Mad Max,

87
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.560
and police station waiting rooms are heaving like the hedgehog carvery at a Gypsy wedding.

88
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.000
PHONE RINGS

89
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.920
Oh, I do apologise, excuse me. I need to take this.

90
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.000
We need to drop Malcolm. Right. I can't get on my high horse

91
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.360
about crime issues the day after my director of communication

92
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.880
may have, ie definitely HAS, committed perjury.

93
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.000
And I like getting on my high horse.

94
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.800
I look good on it. Like a knight.

95
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.200
So they're actually going to pursue this?

96
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.040
Right. Thanks for the heads-up, mate, yeah.

97
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.240
Listen, I need a police station with a lot of exits and entrances,

98
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.760
in case the press show up.

99
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.680
Sam. Sam, Sam. Brentford, right, OK.

100
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.920
Listen, Sam. Get a hold of Greg Fraser for me. I need some hard lawyering.

101
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.240
OK. Pink. Pink, pink flowers.

102
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.840
Pink. For my mother. It's her 80th birthday.

103
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.800
Lovely big bouquet of pink ones.

104
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.400
Lovely. How are you doing?

105
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.320
I'm bitchin', yes, I'm as busy as a two-twatted hooker.

106
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.520
Great. I was thinking, Malcolm...

107
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.400
Maybe you should take a bit of time off, just maybe tour the Highland distilleries,

108
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.320
or whatever it is your people do, you know? Take up stunt kiting.

109
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.520
Well, we don't take advice from a guy who looks like he gels his hair by sticking it up a cow's vagina.

110
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.480
All right, fair enough.

111
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.320
Here's an idea that you could pitch to Millertron 3,000. Yes.

112
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.840
Get him to go to a police station, yeah?

113
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.400
But pick a big one, right? Right. Lewisham. It's more impact in a big one. Yeah, yeah.

114
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.840
But make sure you get as many press there as possible. Yeah. OK.

115
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.440
Dan Miller is visiting a police station.

116
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.600
What? Why? Why, why aren't I visiting a police station?

117
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.200
Why didn't you think of that? Yes, why didn't you think of that? I did, I nearly did, OK?

118
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.360
I was about to think of that. Christ, it's like Harry Potter all over again.

119
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.520
I thought of that, I just didn't write it down.

120
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.440
It was Gandalf at school, but same principle.

121
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.880
Fergus has got an idea about the police backlog, just tell him. Yeah, I'm going to.

122
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.920
It is basically an issue of manpower, so we outsource, we get the private sector in to clear it up.

123
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.920
It's problem solved, it's obvious, really.

124
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.360
Yeah, yeah. Yes, you, yes, it is obvious, that's two obvious things you've missed today. Idiot!

125
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.640
Yeah, what do you think? No, I think it's good,

126
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.280
I mean, private sector dives in and saves us, it plays well for us. Thank you.

127
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.640
Till we get the bill! Cos we got no money.

128
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.880
Anyway, I'm just popping out to Tesco Metro, anyone want a yoghurt?

129
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.480
No, Glenn, no.

130
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.200
Ah, Peter. This War of the Roses with the Home Office?

131
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.480
It ends now. We want a united realm.

132
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480
There's no vision in division.

133
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.160
Well, yes, there is. Anyway, tell Perkin Warbeck over there.

134
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.120
OK, people, could we briefly form a coherent group?

135
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.360
Mary Drake is in the building, she's on her way up.

136
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.960
OK. Shields up, guys. Centurions, we're forming a tortoise.

137
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.200
OK. Terri. Think Socially.

138
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.640
Did I sign off on this?

139
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.160
Because I hadn't heard of Think Socially until I said it just then.

140
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.120
OK, er... So what is it? Simple explanation.

141
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.640
Love to hear it. Yeah. Very... Oh, God, here's Mary.

142
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.920
Bunch up, everyone, so she doesn't see the corpses.

143
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.600
Look, synchronise lies, all right?

144
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.640
Mary, hi, hi. Emma. We met at the away day.

145
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.840
I so enjoyed our mood play.

146
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.080
Yes. You actually did, didn't you?

147
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.960
Ah, you must be the legendary Terri.

148
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.600
I've heard a great deal about you.

149
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.160
Oh, please, don't believe everything that you hear. I fully intend not to.

150
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.440
Stewart, shakras balanced? Er...sorry. Tiny bit of housekeeping.

151
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.480
Terri, um, er...Think Socially. Just checking in on that.

152
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.440
Yes. Yes, it's a go thing. Double stamped, yes.

153
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.320
Mary. Great to see you again.

154
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.240
I'm here in an angry capacity.

155
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.960
Ah! The cream in our coffee, Mary.

156
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.040
The message from the Home Office is this,

157
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.480
"Move away from the backlog, there's nothing to see.

158
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.680
"Let the police do their jobs, let us do ours."

159
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.880
Sorry to be, er...contrary, Mary.

160
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.880
HE CHUCKLES

161
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.240
But, er...Peter and I have just been discussing this very issue.

162
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.880
Shut up. Let me tell you something now.

163
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.680
DoSAC is one rat's whisker away

164
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.360
from being shut down and subsumed by the Home Office

165
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.640
and put in charge of cocking up the tea run!

166
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.080
And I like mine weak and white.

167
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.240
Like my men.

168
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.000
Stewart, any thoughts from within your fucking dream yurt?

169
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.160
I will go and try and defrag this situation.

170
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.560
But I am staying strictly macro.

171
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.840
Subtitles. You need subtitles!

172
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.720
Sorry, er, Think Socially.

173
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.760
Terri, would you mind explaining rationally why I appear to be giving

174
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.800
a ringing endorsement to a piece of shit that I've never even heard of?

175
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.720
It's not my fault, it's the double stamping nonsense, that's the reason. Oh, really? Yeah.

176
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.040
Because, right now, I want to double stamp on your fucking throat.

177
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.280
I'm taking that seriously as a physical threat.

178
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.600
You know, one of the many, many things that baffles me about you is you remain unmurdered!

179
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.200
What time are we due at the Mirror?

180
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.280
Oh, not for another hour. Oh, OK.

181
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.560
Got plenty of time to get into your Boudica mode.

182
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.200
I am woman, hear me roar!

183
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.520
Get your jugs out, get on your chariot.

184
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.920
SHE CHUCKLES

185
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.720
Crikey!

186
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.800
I think, given that I'm hoping to get back into cabinet at some point,

187
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.320
I might...keep my jugs in the cupboard.

188
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.400
THEY CHUCKLE

189
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.800
Or...I suppose I could always pop one of them out

190
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.360
if the interview's flagging.

191
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.640
It's an option!

192
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.040
Um... I did apologise, didn't I, for telling you to fuck off?

193
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.200
Yes.

194
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.280
Good. Because I, you know, I didn't mean it.

195
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.240
I wouldn't be here if I thought you meant it.

196
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.560
I've got plenty of places to fuck off to.

197
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.640
It's a big funeral home, isn't it?

198
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.120
KNOCK ON DOOR

199
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.960
M Tucker. Olly. Malcolm.

200
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.040
Um, we need to have a little chat.

201
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.360
You're not splitting up with me, are you?

202
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.200
Because I'm pregnant and it's quads, so, you know. You're not laughing.

203
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.280
Well, I'm laughing on the inside.

204
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.520
Which is a tad ironic,

205
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.560
because I'm leaving here in five minutes to get arrested. Hang on.

206
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.680
Sorry, er...you're going to be arrested at the exact same time

207
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.880
that Dan Miller's doing his Lewisham walkabout?

208
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.640
Yeah. But I'm going to Brentford where nobody will be watching me

209
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.560
because they'll all be with him.

210
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.840
So the Leader of the Opposition is going to be filmed at a police station

211
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.640
at the exact moment as his Head Of Communications is being arrested.

212
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.120
Yes! OK, great, great, so that's a sack full of face-chewing rats,

213
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.560
thank you very much. Look, it's... this is what you have to deal with, right?

214
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.920
It's just another day at the fuck office.

215
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.880
So now, I have to step into your shoes, but after you've shat in them?

216
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.120
Olly, look at me. I'm not pulling anything out of a magic hat.

217
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.200
The rabbits have fallen to pieces,

218
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.800
their fucking heads are coming off and frightening the kids.

219
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.920
So somebody else is going to have to help out.

220
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.200
Well, who says I even want to be you, Malcolm?

221
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.880
Who says that? Nobody says that.

222
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.240
Except every screaming atom of that etiolated stick of fuck you call a body says that.

223
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.760
Every fibre of your being, every stamen...says that.

224
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.120
But you are not me, Olly.

225
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.720
No.

226
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.160
And you never will be me.

227
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.640
I knew Malcolm F Tucker, sir.

228
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.960
And you are not Malcolm Fucking Tucker.

229
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.440
You're not even fucking Manchester's top Malcolm Tucker tribute band.

230
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.800
And trying to be me, you?

231
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.640
Trying to be me will fucking kill you. I give you 18 months

232
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.600
before you're a washed-out, weeping alcoholic

233
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.760
with no fucking bladder control.

234
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.480
Sleeping on your brother-in-law's sofa.

235
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.160
And so on and so on, it doesn't have to be like that now, Malcolm,

236
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.840
politics has actually changed.

237
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.800
Oh? Right. Yeah, yeah. And you probably haven't noticed because you've been on transmit

238
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.480
for the last fucking eight years Waa-waa-waa-waa-waa!

239
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.880
And whilst you've been doing that, everybody else has been changing,

240
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.480
and it's all a bit softcore now, it's all a bit algorithms now.

241
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.840
You don't have to be Malcolm Tucker to sit in that chair.

242
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.960
Oh, how quickly they grow up. You fucking think you know me?

243
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.480
Well, yeah. Yeah, I know you.

244
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.400
You know Jackie fucking Chan about me.

245
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.920
You know fuck all about me!

246
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.520
I am totally beyond the realms of your fucking tousle-haired,

247
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.400
fucking dim-witted compre-fucking-hension.

248
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.280
I don't just take this fucking job home, you know.

249
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.080
I take this job home, it fucking ties me to the bed,

250
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.800
and it fucking fucks me from arsehole to breakfast.

251
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.280
Then, it wakes me up in the morning with a cup full of piss

252
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.200
slammed in my face, slaps me about the chops,

253
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.200
to make sure I'm awake enough so it can kick me in the fucking bollocks.

254
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.000
This job has taken me in every hole in my fucking body.

255
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.320
Malcolm is gone, you can't know Malcolm,

256
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.320
because Malcolm is not here!

257
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.840
Malcolm fucking left the building fucking years ago!

258
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.240
This is a fucking husk.

259
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.160
I am a fucking host for this fucking job.

260
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.880
Do you want this job?

261
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.760
Yeah. Yes, you do fucking want this job.

262
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.720
Then, you're going to have to fucking swallow this whole fucking life

263
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.200
and let it grow inside you like a parasite.

264
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.960
Getting bigger and bigger and bigger until it fucking eats your insides alive

265
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.320
and it stares out of your eyes and tells you what to do.

266
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.600
Malcolm, this sounds like the fucking video you leave on YouTube

267
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.800
after you've blown your brains out.

268
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.880
I'm as dead as fucking 2 Tone.

269
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.840
But I can fashion my own exit.

270
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.480
Oh, Christ! What, are you going to fly to Switzerland

271
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.120
and have a wank off a nurse and a bye-bye pill, are you?

272
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.760
Funny, funny man.

273
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.520
Political exit.

274
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.200
No, I know.

275
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.840
I'm going to leave the stage with my head held fucking high, right?

276
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.760
What you're going to see is a masterclass in fucking dignity, son.

277
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.640
The audience will be on their feet. "There he goes," they'll say.

278
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.240
"No friends, no real friends. No children, no glory, no memoirs."

279
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.880
Well, fuck them.

280
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.960
Hello. Hello.

281
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.040
Hi. Nicola Murray, Leader of... Oh! I've got to stop saying that.

282
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.520
Hello. Helen, hi. Declan.

283
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.720
Declan, hi.

284
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.880
Nice to see you again. Yes, again, er...

285
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.600
Do you not remember me?

286
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.720
I, I'm so sorry, you look very familiar,

287
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.080
but it's just I meet so, well, I met so many people.

288
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.600
You're for the chop!

289
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.640
SHE CHUCKLES

290
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.440
Oh, right. You're... OK!

291
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.600
Uh-huh! Mr Chop. Yeah.

292
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.560
I'll look forward to giving you a bit of a grilling!

293
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.440
Well, this might be your chance, I'm the one doing the interview. Are you? Great.

294
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.600
Here we... Here's an old friend. Hello. Oh, yeah. Wow! Yeah.

295
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.200
Still, still doing that joke!

296
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.760
Big, though, isn't it?

297
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.360
Um, if you'd just excuse us for one minute, Mr Ch... Um...

298
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.240
Declan. Declan, Declan, yes, yes, yes, of course. Yeah, sorry.

299
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.240
I just need a quick strategy chat. Sure.

300
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.920
I am...ever so close to being on the verge

301
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.400
of balling my fucking eyes out disappointed about this.

302
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.480
I mean, this was it, was it? What was the alternative?

303
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.960
Going on Strictly Come Dancing

304
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.280
and doing a fucking hookie waltz with Abu Hamza?

305
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.960
This is pretty low. This is lower than my mother's pelvic floor, Helen.

306
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.480
I had to virtually go on the game to get you this.

307
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.640
So frankly, I don't care if he wants to roll around in apple sauce with you,

308
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.360
get in there and do as you're told.

309
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.200
Right. I will go, because I'm choosing to go in,

310
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.160
but I just need you to know, for the record...

311
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.240
Just get in there before I push you in.

312
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.000
If they video this as well, I'm going to swallow my own fucking thumbs.

313
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.120
OK.

314
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.240
So, sorry about that, yes, just... Not at all.

315
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.560
Now, we're going to be videoing this too, if that's OK,

316
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.880
so I thought interview first, then, I'll get myself into my chop costume and we do a little double act.

317
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.400
What news from the front, my hardy legionnaires?

318
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.880
Er...Forest Hill running smooth, Croydon lag time, get it?

319
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.360
Down 15 minutes, slamming the hoods.

320
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.320
Boom! Fuck the Home Office.

321
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.640
Yeah. Double stamped. Fuck the police!

322
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.960
No, that doesn't work. Christ, I haven't felt this alive for months.

323
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.680
I feel like I've had a health scare.

324
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.800
OK. Dan Miller's station visit's on.

325
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.360
He's going to be meeting and greeting. Urgh!

326
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.760
Er, Emma, which police station is it? Lewisham.

327
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.320
Actually, Phil, how long is the waiting time there?

328
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.360
Well, that's a big nick. Tough nut to crack.

329
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.000
Phil, can you stop pretending you're in The Sweeney and just give me a fucking fact?

330
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.400
How long? It's coming down. Hour, hour and a half, tops. OK.

331
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.720
So listen, I was thinking of learning a new language.

332
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.080

333
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.480
Oh, sorry, got to take that.

334
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.600
Oh! It's my sister.

335
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.640
Peter, we need to get as many staff as possible down to Lewisham, OK?

336
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.320
When Miller gets there, we need them to be processing like, like human Pentiums.

337
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.040
Yeah, I, I agree, I don't care who's queuing for arrest

338
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.680
or if they go on to kill again, Lewisham's the priority.

339
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.800
Brilliant! We make it seem like Dan Miller's the problem, he's wasting police time.

340
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.560
He's the backlog. Err, Peter. Um? Yeah.

341
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.840
When you have a moment, can I get a quote on Malcolm's arrest?

342
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.600
Malcolm? Tucker.

343
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.640
Malcolm Tucker's being arrested?

344
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.600
Well, I was thinking of coming down there in October anyway.

345
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.440
What the fuck? This is... I've been getting calls for 15 minutes.

346
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.720
Not the same sources that told you David Beckham was running for mayor?

347
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.240
Malcolm's solicitor phoned the police, who phones journalists, and they tell me.

348
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.440
And after all that people phoning you... Yes? Yes?

349
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.960
..then you just, then, you just have a little tuna salad, do you, watch Loose Women?

350
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.560
You lay an egg over there and...

351
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.160
Terri, Terri, can you spot who the blockage is in this office?

352
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.760
I have been getting on with doing exactly what you told me to,

353
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.880
which was... What? ..dealing with this arrest backlog. Can't you react to events? Fuck!

354
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.040
Yes, just doing one thing at a time, are you, because you're a uni-tasker?

355
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.600
All the press will focus on, right, is Malcolm's arrest,

356
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.800
and not on anyone else who's being arrested, we have been trumped again! No, this is good.

357
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.480
We swoop in, sort the system, and we get Tucker in clink, it's a double stamp.

358
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.600
Which police station's he going to? Brentford, apparently. Brentford.

359
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.840
Shit, it's off-grid! It'd be here, the vector would be here.

360
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.760
Right. OK, listen up, everybody.

361
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.160
Forget Lewisham.

362
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.760
I want every warm body we've got down to Brentford.

363
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.120
Let's put the fucker in a cell with a genuine psychopath.

364
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.560
Can I just make sure that this is a double stamp?

365
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.000
This is a double stamp.

366
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.880
Yeah, well, don't worry, I can come down

367
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.120
and I'll have that wall whitewashed in about half an hour.

368
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.040
So you're telling me I literally cannot get arrested?

369
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.040
Look, I haven't got the staff to deal with the workload right now.

370
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.040
My client is doing everything he can to help you with your inquiries.

371
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.520
They are processing arrests at Lewisham, head down there.

372
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.600
We can't go to Lewisham. Why not?

373
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.280
Dan Miller's there, fondling truncheons. Oh!

374
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.160
This, as you can see, is our control... Hello, Dan Miller, hello.

375
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.400
Hello, Dan Miller.

376
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.160
..room - nerve centre, shall we say? - where we've been

377
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.040
managing the situation. Hi, Dan Miller.

378
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.160
So you must be incredibly concerned with the log jam we've been seeing.

379
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.280
Oh, absolutely, yesterday was a very challenging day.

380
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.600
I can imagine.

381
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.120
Yeah, but since we've had the additional help from the private contractors,

382
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.680
we're really getting on top of it.

383
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.640
Great. Well, well, yeah. Can I just...?

384
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.960
Oh, of course.

385
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.840
Olly. What the fuck are we doing here? Everything's fine.

386
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.160
I'm like lube at a funeral.

387
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.120
Yeah. I can't believe it but DoSAC have actually turned this around, they've Apollo 13'd it.

388
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.240
Fucking press!

389
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.880
Excuse me, is there another way out of here?

390
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.360
You could hang yourself. Fuck off!

391
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.600
It's down there, turn right, on the left.

392
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.160
Have you heard that Malcolm Tucker's going to get arrested?

393
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.360
Two minutes, I will have something for you on that.

394
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.200
Tell me that was a rhetorical question. Malcolm was supposed to get arrested quietly,

395
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.120
on the other side of town, but, obviously, it's actually got out.

396
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.480
How?

397
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.760
Do I have to say this? Do I have to say it out loud? Because the police...

398
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.680
Oh, why don't you say it out loud?

399
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.240
Yes, yes, maybe they can do me a favour and throw you down the fucking stairs.

400
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.960
This is basically the same fucking exit.

401
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.840
This is rubbish!

402
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.040
This is, this is literally rubbish.

403
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.640
Malcolm! Malcolm! There he is! There he is! Mr Tucker!

404
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.880
Hey! Get the fuck back here!

405
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.440
Jesus Christ.

406
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.640
OK, go. Go, go, go!

407
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.000
You drive off like that again and I'll stick your meter so far down your throat,

408
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.200
you'll be able to tell the price of your next shit.

409
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.640
Why the fuck have you brought me to a police station

410
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.520
when one of our most senior figures is about to be arrested?

411
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.480
Um...don't clasp your hands behind your back, it makes you look like you've been cuffed.

412
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.640
TELEPHONE RINGS

413
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.120
Oh, it's him. Marvellous!

414
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.320
Put him on speakerphone, he might want to do an interview down the line.

415
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.920
Oliver Reeder. 'Olly, some press turned up at Brentford.'

416
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.200
I've just been chased into a cab. It's like Hard Day's fucking Night.

417
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.720
'Where can I go?' Er...I'm hearing Hackney's good, 82% operational.

418
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.120
Olly, will you please keep the rest of the press there,

419
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.840
with Dan in Lewisham?

420
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.320
Please. I need my dignity.

421
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.680
Come on, give me my fucking dignity... Er, thanks for calling.

422
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.360
OK, we need to get out of here as quickly as we possibly can.

423
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.160
Thank you very much. That was really, er, wonderful. Carry on.

424
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.880
Super, super station. Love what you've done with it.

425
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.240
Malcolm's gone. What's happening? Did he escape?

426
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.840
No, the press were there, it was taking too long.

427
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.400
Christ's sake! It's Tora fucking Bora all over again.

428
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.840
Where did he go? We've got to get everyone there now.

429
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.120
I'll find out, I'll find out.

430
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.240
Let's get a chopper in the air. Be like the OJ chase! He is getting bloody arrested today, OK?

431
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.680
Absolutely. It's legacy stuff - the men who threw Malcolm Tucker in the slammer!

432
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.920
Can I just say my idea for pop-up prisons doesn't seem so stupid now.

433
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.680
Oh, blah, blah! Being this close won't... Hackney, Hackney!

434
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.280
Where's Hackney? There. That's Hackney, right there. OK, OK, it's my manor.

435
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.440
Adam, Adam, make it happen. Boots on the ground, yeah?

436
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.400
This is fucking awesome, it's like COBRA! I hope I get defence next.

437
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.320
Want the headset now, don't you? Fuck off.

438
00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.120
I'm making myself an Earl Grey, Glenn. Can I get you something?

439
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.760
No, I'm tea-d out, thank you, Terri.

440
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.320
Oh. Do you want a hand? You could open that cupboard door.

441
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.040
Are you moving offices or something?

442
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.880
Yeah, you could say that. I'm going to a prison cell.

443
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.440
Oh, Glenn! Yeah.

444
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.640
No! Yeah.

445
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.400
I've decided I'm going to resign.

446
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.320
Then after that I'm going to go to a police station and hand myself in.

447
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.320
No, no, no, no... I perjured myself at the inquiry, Terri.

448
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.120
They'll find out. They always do.

449
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.280
I'll have a roof over my head, three meals a day and regular sex.

450
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.560
I might even work out. Get some abs.

451
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.920
What about your sister, Glenn? You've got to whitewash her walls!

452
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.120
Come out, everyone!

453
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.520
Tally-ho!

454
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.960
Yoo-hoo!

455
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.040
Come on, bring out your fucking dead.

456
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.080
Right, everybody, listen. I've got an announcement to make.

457
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.800
Erm... What is it? Have you got an erection? No.

458
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.760
I would like to tell you all that I'm resigning.

459
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:50.920
Is that it? No, you closeted Regency homosexual, that is not it.

460
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.040
Morally, this department is in the gutter.

461
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.880
Thanks for the speech, Glenn, but we have work... You stay and take the punishment! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

462
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.360
I will lamp you, with a lamp. Glenn, you've gone a tiny bit psychotic, my love.

463
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.840
You, Fergus,

464
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.600
when you asked me to join you, all you had was your principles,

465
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.520
but over the last two years, you've bent like a human fucking palm tree,

466
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.040
swaying to the guff of these six-toed, born-to-rule pony fuckers.

467
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.200
If you're going to go, just go.

468
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.640
Oh! Spare us this Peter Finch bullshit.

469
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.560
Adam, you're waiting for your turn!

470
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.400
Oh, no, I remember!

471
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.160
It's your turn right now!

472
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.240
Brilliant. Bring it.

473
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.880
You are simply the most loathsome human being I have ever met. Yeah.

474
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.040
You were so well suited at the Mail, it's a shame you came over here.

475
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.120
Hear, hear!

476
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.120
Do you know what? I hate you both. Tweedletwat and Tweedleprick.

477
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.360
You contribute absolutely nothing to the world,

478
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.240
so thank fucking God you have no power.

479
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.440
Er, we do actually. It's... No, you don't.

480
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.320
And, Peter, it's been dreadful. I hope your cock falls off.

481
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.760
Phil, do you know what you are? You're like an eight-year-old trapped in a 12-year-old's body.

482
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.120
This is great! Why is no-one filming this?

483
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.080
And Emma. Yeah, yeah, do Emma, do Emma.

484
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.480
Yeah. Emma, I'm sorry, you're just a standard-issue insipid posh bitch.

485
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.520
That's it!

486
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.960
Terri!

487
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.400
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

488
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.360
I don't think I've ever met anyone quite so proud,

489
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.720
and yet quite so useless.

490
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.600
But I do have to thank you, because I have managed to stay in shape

491
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.600
purely through the energy I spend in pitying you every day.

492
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.080
Glenn, you're just embarrassing yourself.

493
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.960
Fuck you all up the wrong 'un! Ta-ta! Bye-bye!

494
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.040
That was better than IMAX Inception.

495
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.040
EMMA: Poor, poor Glenn.

496
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.600
Should we try and get him back?

497
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.280
Fuck, no! He's gone completely mental.

498
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.040
He's gone Glenn-tal.

499
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.880
There he is, there he is!

500
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.480
Malcolm! Can you tell us why you're here today?

501
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.160
Why are you here today, Malcolm?

502
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.760
Are you here to be arrested?

503
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.720
Nothing to say.

504
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.320
THEY SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

505
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.920
Nothing to say. There's nothing to say.

506
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.440
Out of my way, you fucking human Mooncup.

507
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.920
Have a bit of class.

508
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.200
Is this arrest by appointment, Mr Tucker?

509
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.760
You do not have to say anything.

510
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.280
However, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned

511
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.320
something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be...

512
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.920
Malcolm! Malcolm!

513
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.640
THEY SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

514
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.120
Quiet! Quiet! Quieten down!

515
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.080
Quieten down! Give us something.

516
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.480
I have a brief statement I will read on behalf of my client.

517
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.080
"I am innocent of all charges and vow to do everything in my power to clear my name.

518
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.520
"I will fight this all the way, and I am confident no jury will be able

519
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.040
"to look me in the eye and say anything other than I am an innocent man.

520
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.720
"But to avoid any distraction to my official duties,

521
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.080
"and to begin preparations for my acquittal,

522
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.160
"I am standing down as senior communications officer to my party,

523
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.600
"and, with heavy heart, I am leaving top-tier politics for good."

524
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.160
That is all we have to say at this time. Thank you.

525
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.200
Have you anything further to add?

526
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.360
No, I want to say something, I want to say something.

527
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.080
Doesn't matter.

528
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.000
THEY SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

529
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.720
Have you been sacked, Mr Tucker?

530
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.920
'..standing down as senior communications officer to my party...'

531
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.440
Oh, I do feel grubby. I feel fucking great! It's a huge scalp.

532
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.600
Size of a pizza!

533
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.840
How about a toast to the old bastard's hopeful incarceration

534
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.960
with a fine 12-year-old Glen-fuck it?!

535
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.400
WOMAN LAUGHS

536
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.000
I haven't worked all that long,

537
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.160
or all that closely with Malcolm Tucker,

538
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.280
but I wish him luck in clearing his name,

539
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.680
although, obviously, if he is found guilty,

540
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.000
then the full weight of the law should be...

541
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.520
Oh, sorry. Full force of the law should be...

542
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.080
I haven't worked all that long...

543
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.200
With him gone, um, I feel fresh hope we can mend

544
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.560
and rebuild a credible politics of integrity and honour.

545
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.360
So, er, thank you very much for coming,

546
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.640
I look forward to seeing much more of you in the coming weeks and months.

547
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.600
Not you, Rod, obviously. You're a twat.

548
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.960
But... In spite of the awards, er, er, for being a twat, I believe.

549
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.480
So, thanks, fellas. Don't be strangers.

550
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.280
Oh, Phil, is it too much for you? It's strong! Oh, poor old Phil!

551
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.120
Did you get it in your eye?

552
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.480
I've got an image now of you puking up on some stripper's shoes

553
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.880
and then bursting into tears.

554
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.440
Drinking on the job, Peter. Why not? You've already got the efficiency of a man who's half-cut.

555
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.920
Oh, then I must have dreamt that my idea had successfully reduced the arrest backlog.

556
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.400
DoSAC did do rather well today, er, actually. Thank you.

557
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.880
But there's a conspicuous blockage that will lead to a personnel change.

558
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.480
Stewart, you're out. You're going to be pickled in a think tank.

559
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.840
WOMAN: What?

560
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.680
Of course I am, Mary. And whose authority is this coming from, hmm?

561
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.200
The PM, whilst acknowledging the need for thoughts,

562
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.120
is keener on actions these days.

563
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.080
I'm going to be providing those.

564
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.080
Stewart, there's no need for you to clear your desk,

565
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.760
cos you're a walking thought pod, aren't you?

566
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.760
Absolutely. Thank you very much.

567
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.040
Thanks.

568
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.800
Um, you know...

569
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.880
I've spent ten years detoxifying this party, hmm?

570
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.200
It's been a bit like renovating an old, old house, yeah?

571
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.960
You can take out a sexist beam here, a callous window there,

572
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.840
replace the odd homophobic roof tile.

573
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.120
But after a while you realise that this renovation is doomed.

574
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.680
Because the foundations are built on what

575
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.080
I can only describe as a solid bed of cunts.

576
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.320
Wow!

577
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.560
EMMA: Bye, Stewart.

578
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.760
Bye-bye, Stewart.

579
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.840
Thanks for everything!

580
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.800
Sod it.

581
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.360
Now, if we can just get a couple of pictures,

582
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.440
someone will give you a knife and fork,

583
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.120
and if you can pretend to eat me.

584
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.240
What a great day!

585
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.080
Peter? Sorry, the Sun have just been on.

586
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.480
I'm afraid a prisoner who was accused of assaulting his wife was accidentally released,

587
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.000
he's gone back and attacked the wife and children. Oh, shit in the couscous!

588
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.440
EMMA: Right, OK, we need a joint statement.

589
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.200
Both departments were too busy with the backlogs. Fuck it all!

590
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.480
Yeah, basically stuff fell through the cracks. Exactly. No-one's fault.

591
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.520
Can this be double-stamped? Fuck the stamps!

592
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.520
And whose fault is it the man was released?

593
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.440
Terri, meeting in my office. Well, uh, in Peter's office. Well, I'm meeting in my office.

594
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.600
I'm meeting in my office.

595
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.040
THEY ALL TALK OVER EACH OTHER

596
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.760
What a shit day!
