WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.200
This programme contains strong language.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm finding Mr Tickel's tent-based twattery even more annoying.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.680
Peter Mannion has been picking on a man with a history of depression.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.400
..I call app Britain. App. I call app Britain. I call app Britain.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880
Silicone playgrounds are, is, go.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.840
I just hope Mannion can keep his baccy stained fingers out of it.

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.720
I call you up, app...

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
I couldn't have looked more of a twat unless I'd announced it dressed as a mermaid with scallops on my tits!

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.800
I was picked up at 7. Of course I haven't walked the dog.

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.600
I barely had time to take myself for a shit.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.840
Phil, I'm sure you have Peter withdrawal symptoms

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.520
but I need you to keep an eye on the Tickel issue.

13
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.840
Thought camp ETA 13 minutes, OK? You're taking the bridge, Kieran.

14
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.560
You can start by not referring to him as gypo or gypsy, Phil.

15
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.080
It's not the abbreviation that's the problem.

16
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.480
If he has a thorn in his paw it must be from when you took him for a walk yesterday.

17
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.200
What do you mean, you're in charge? You are not in fucking charge.

18
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
You've got to keep me informed.

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.320
I want the full crunch on all the feeds as usual, everything below the equator.

20
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.480
Take him to the dog hospital.

21
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.360
No, I'm not being sarcastic. There is one.

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040
The number will be in the folder. Try and keep an eye on things, right? Bile... Mm, what?

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.080
Where are you taking us, Stewart? This mind Kampf is in the middle of nowhere.

24
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.080
Thought camp, Peter, and isolation is the mother of renewal. We shall retreat to go forward.

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.640
Terrible signal. Phil sounded like he was phoning in a report on an African coup.

26
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.160
Why's he even gone in today? I put him on Tickel oversight. Oh, the eviction.

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.360
Well, cutting the guy ropes on his tent is hardly the siege of Troy.

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.240
Bailiffs thought it would be easier today, quicker or quieter.

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.280
I want Phil sealed off, right? He makes no statement today, not even off the record.

30
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.120
He wanted to feel useful. Then he should sell his organs.

31
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.160
Glenn. What? What the fuck are you doing here?

32
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.320
Oh, God, you're not living here, are you?

33
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.880
Oh, no. I've just go some stuff I've got to catch up on.

34
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.280
Plus one of my neighbours is having a rooftop barbecue

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
and I didn't fancy being bombarded with chicken bones and Radio 1.

36
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.120
Anyway, why aren't you on Stewart's away day?

37
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.400
Drinking herbal tea and playing leapfrog? I told Stewart where to get off.

38
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.080
Yeah, well, we've got the whole palace to ourselves, eh? Rosencratz and Guildenstern.

39
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.320
But very much alive. Well, one of us.

40
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.400
I'll put the kettle on. Sure.

41
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.040
Easy on the milk, Shaky Hands.

42
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.880
OK, people, abandon phones all ye who enter here.

43
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.280
And watches, too. Time is a leash on the dog of ideas

44
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.480
This is like some weird inverted Dodge City.

45
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.200
Presumably we're allowed to keep our six shooters. I might want to blow my brains out.

46
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.160
Stewart, my son's coming back from a school trip

47
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.040
and I'm gonna need to find out what time the coaches are arriving.

48
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.800
Sorry, Mary, same rules for everyone.

49
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.880
Reception will take a message, yeah,

50
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.920
but I mean we all have children, yeah? I don't literally but...

51
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.800
OK, lovely people. Let's go truffling in the forest of knowledge.

52
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.480
Come on, quick. Quick. Fuck, fuck, it's hot.

53
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.040
Jesus Christ. What's happened?

54
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.000
Is this the start of some zombie apocalypse?

55
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.440
What are you guys doing in?

56
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.600
Well, work comes first with me, Adam. You know that.

57
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.440
Protestant ethic. Not that I'm at all anti-Catholic.

58
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.240
You're in for...? A meeting with Fergus.

59
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.640
Heads up. Lady and the Tramp are in, too.

60
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.680
Yeah, I know. Cheers. Just make sure you copy me in on any minutes. OK.

61
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.520
How about you copy that, yeah?

62
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.040
Cos it's party business. It's not ministerial.

63
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.520
The meeting is in the department.

64
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.680
While Peter is absent, I'm his surrogate - the king's hand.

65
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.440
Yeah. Finish him off with that hand as well, do you?

66
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.760
Prick.

67
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.520
I may... I may be needed. I've been needed in the past.

68
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.640
OK, people. I'd like to start this session with a question.

69
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.040
When is a party not a party?

70
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.800
When it's at your house? Peter!

71
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.640
A party is not a party when it is plural.

72
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.360
There she is, the party, singular.

73
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.080
She thinks like you, she votes like you, she is not you

74
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.800
and yet of course she is you.

75
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.040
HE SIGHS

76
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.040
I feel like I've joined the Scientologists.

77
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.080
Some of these people want a federal Britain, others don't,

78
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.280
and as long as we continue to do nothing we can call that consensus.

79
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.080
Why am I the only senior minister here? Is JB punishing me?

80
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.200
Look, Mary Drake's here, Home Office.

81
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.600
And yes, JB is punishing you.

82
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.880
OK, let's, let's MacIntyre this. Stand up.

83
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.440
MacIntyre? In fact, chairs to the side, please.

84
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.720
Great, vague prancing about.

85
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.080
Isn't that one of the fundamental principles of democracy?

86
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.400
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter, do you want to share your thoughts? Hmm?

87
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.840
No, we just hoped we were going to do some dancing, er, Stewart.

88
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.240
What, Merce Cunningham, something like that?

89
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.560
OK, maybe later you can share it with us. Fabulous.

90
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.520
But first, let me share something with you.

91
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.360
Silicone Playgrounds, yeah?

92
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.240
What caused this slow motion pile up? Shall we sit down and chew over hash tag epic fail

93
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.400
or shall we try and get some solutions on their feet?

94
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.320
That's it just put it at the side, Peter.

95
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.040
I was hoping to catch the snooker after I've finished collating those healthy workplace stats.

96
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.960
Just down there. Glenn, you're a marvel.

97
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.440
You're like a modern day Jeeves. Only not modern... day.

98
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.480
You're like Jeeves but only not as good.

99
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.760
This meeting, is it something I should be in on?

100
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.520
Well, it's not really a meeting, it's more sort of faces with lips making noise.

101
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.600
Uh-huh. Sounds like a meeting.

102
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.800
Yeah, well you know, Fergus just called someone in

103
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.000
for a... for an exploratory chat. Right.

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.640
Stop Slytherin getting wind of it.

105
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.640
Oh, hang on. I've got to go.

106
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.800
You need to get back to your telly? It takes a while to warm up, doesn't it?

107
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.560
Here we are at the coal face.

108
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.360
Ah, Adam, this is Tara Strachan.

109
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.280
Hello, lovely to meet you. Hi there. Really lovely, lovely.

110
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.080
Shall we...? Just... Thank you. She's an economist and a lady.

111
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.840
Yes, obviously. Lovely. Ahem. What's going on? Who's the skirt?

112
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.160
I'd love to bring you up to speed, Phil, I really would,

113
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.960
but I'm not going to live long enough.

114
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.040
So tell you what? Why don't you go and help Glenn watch his telly?

115
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.040
I think the dancing's on in a minute.

116
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040
I really like your coat, by the way. Thank you.

117
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.360
It's like a leopard. It is a little bit. Or a cheetah.

118
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.720
Am I supply-side economics? No. Oh, bugger.

119
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.080
OK, Mary, you've got to help Peter work out what political concept he is. You have one guess left.

120
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.720
Keep the energy up, guys. Chins up, yeah.

121
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.440
Am I a solid, sensible concept? No.

122
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.080
The beauty of this model... Yeah. ..is that micro banking can happen anywhere, OK?

123
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.640
Great. Small, low interest loans, that's the way forward.

124
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.960
This is terrific, I mean, it's so fucking us it's brilliant.

125
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.600
Adam! Adam!

126
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.920
Oh, don't worry, I don't mind swearing. Shows passion.

127
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.480
I've done some community enterprise case studies.

128
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.080
Sisters who want to set up a pop-up bakers in a disused travel agents.

129
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.400
The boiler guy who wants to take on an apprentice.

130
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.920
Yeah. The helping hand for hands-on people.

131
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.680
Yeah. I like that, that's great, that's really good.

132
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.960
Making sure the can-doers don't get canned.

133
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.440
Terrific, yeah, really good.

134
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.400
Would I be comfortable or uncomfortable...?

135
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.120
Yes or no questions only, please, Peter.

136
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.760
Would I be uncomfortable talking to Andrew Marr about this concept on the television?

137
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.440
Yes.

138
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.960
Am I diversity? No.

139
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.280
You're out of questions, Peter.

140
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.880
Oh, for fuck's sake. Inclusivity's practically the same as diversity.

141
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.120
No, it's not. No, it isn't, Peter.

142
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.680
I could be at home watching the snooker with a bottle of unpronounceable scotch.

143
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.240
Can I sit down now?

144
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.160
I'm sitting down, I don't care.

145
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.400
Actually we can all sit down now. Thanks, Peter.

146
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.680
So take a chair because Emma's going to co-steer module 4 with me.

147
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.800
We're gonna do a kind of Top Trumps stats check on the PM's future enemies, yeah?

148
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.640
Strengths, weaknesses, blocking moves and take downs.

149
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.600
Em. Great, thank you, Stewart.

150
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.240
You've turned into the wrong Mitford sister.

151
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.720
Basically, we'd set up a network of micro-credit lenders at neighbourhood level.

152
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.200
This is great. So what would it be called? Like the Citizens' Bank or...?

153
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.560
The People's Bank. Erm, community... The credit fund.

154
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.200
No, no, credit's a bad word. Negative.

155
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.920
Something with advance. The We Bank.

156
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.680
The We Bank? I like that.

157
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.800
Although it does sound a bit like a sperm bank but for wee.

158
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.640
Bit of a farce going on here with your Mr Tickle.

159
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.360
They've turned up to evict him and he's not there.

160
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.800
Good, self-evicted. Gone. Problem solved.

161
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.720
Anyway, what's going on with Fergus and Adam and the sexy stranger?

162
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.360
She's an economist, apparently.

163
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.680
Oh, don't be ridiculous, she's far too attractive.

164
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.440
You can get sexy economists. What about Stephanie Flanders?

165
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.840
Yeah, that's true. I quite like Emily Maitlis.

166
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.920
Really? Oh, I'm sure she'd love a grey pounding.

167
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.720
Do you want to have an idea-gasm? Yes, please.

168
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:42.000
Ask me how we'd initially fund this? How would we initially fund this? How would we initially fund this?

169
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.880
A one-off Robin Hood tax.

170
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.840
Steal from the fat cats,

171
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.720
raise enough seed capital for hundreds of start-up funds for fledgling businesses.

172
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.800
You know what? This could work really well for us.

173
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.400
This... This is... Yeah.

174
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.880
Yeah? I mean, let's just talk figures.

175
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.800
What sort of start-up capital are we talking here? Erm...

176
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.920
Not very much. I think we're looking at about 2 billion.

177
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.080
2 billion. 2 billion.

178
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.760
Good. I erm... Well, obviously, I'd have to ring the Treasury.

179
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.520
Sure. And twist a few arms. You know, it'll take a couple of weeks to work out

180
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.120
but we are extremely keen to set that process in motion.

181
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.640
Nicola Murray. We're assuming she's on her way out.

182
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.320
That's a given. She's a political accident nobody can quite remember how it happened.

183
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.360
Contender one - Ben Swain.

184
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:32.600
Now, ABC1's over-thirties consider him shifty and unfocused.

185
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.560
Can't think why that is.

186
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.240
Geoff Holhurst. Tiny head. Yeah, an Achilles head.

187
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.400
Ah, Dan Miller, definitely our anti-fave.

188
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.040
Charming, charismatic, clever, dedicated and phwoar, God, he's hot.

189
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.520
Yes, thanks, Em.

190
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.160
OK, let's architecturalise this, yeah? Oh, don't bother.

191
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.200
If it's Ben Swain, we all shout "sweaty Swain" as he dehydrates himself through PMQs.

192
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.520
Holhurst looks like a shepherd dressed up to meet the Queen

193
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.960
and if it's Dan Miller we're fucked.

194
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.560
I should tell you I do also have a meeting with Dan Miller booked in.

195
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.960
What? I would just knock that right on the head, don't do it.

196
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.920
Well, he's in opposition, we rule.

197
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.080
We're the rulers, we're the governors.

198
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.920
And in the end, this is so fucking us. Fuck, yeah. Yeah.

199
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.440
Here, Tara Strachan, LSE, Harvard,

200
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.600
author of Strapped: Why We're In Debt To Each Other,

201
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.160
Small Is Bountiful, expert in micro financing

202
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.080
and community credit guilds.

203
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.960
God, that sounds dreary. Bloody hell, that's all 4th sector stuff.

204
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.440
I mean, why have they kept me out here like a stray dog?

205
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.840
And why are they keeping Mannion out of it?

206
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.440
This is government business.

207
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.320
Right, that's enough, stop, stop, stop. I demand an explanation.

208
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.760
Sorry, Phil, we're busy.

209
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.680
Maybe come back in, I don't know, 2017?

210
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.520
As Peter's representative, it's as though you lied to him. That's probably illegal.

211
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.280
If you want to see something probably illegal, pass me that fucking stapler over there.

212
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.440
Er, listen is there a problem with me being here?

213
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.840
You're not supposed to be here.

214
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.720
The minister is unaware that you're here, so you have to leave.

215
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.880
So she's a security risk? Oh, no - I'd forgotten. You're not allowed within 50 feet of a woman.

216
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.240
How d'you explain this, then? I'm within 50 feet of you. You're a woman.

217
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.240
Oh, brilliant. That is really good. Fuck! Tickle's dead!

218
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.760
Oh, shit. Jesus.

219
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.080
Oh, God, he's killed himself. Suicide.

220
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.720
He used a car exhaust.

221
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.080
Hey, classic. The Bohemian Rhapsody of suicides.

222
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.760
Oh, Phil, for fuck's sake. I'm sorry, I just, you know...

223
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.920
I mean it's, it's... It's good, in a way.

224
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.600
He was drawing attention to an issue

225
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.800
and now he's not drawing attention to it because...

226
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.320
Can you just turn it down, all right, because we have somebody in?

227
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.480
I'm gonna ring Terri.

228
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.440
God, I was just ringing you. I got a heads-up from Reuters

229
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.240
whilst I was planting the dwarf irises.

230
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.960
This is gonna take a lot of managing.

231
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.120
Who's that? No-one. Ah, Minister, sorry.

232
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.280
Yes, I'm halfway through a draft. Any minute. Thank you, Terri.

233
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.720
Is this the homeless nurse? That's awful.

234
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.000
Er, yes, this is Mr Tickel, it's a tragedy.

235
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.920
Homeless out of choice, right, Fergus?

236
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.840
Er, now is really not the time to...

237
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.360
This is a tragedy and it's complicated.

238
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.360
Not complicated enough for you to voice any public opposition.

239
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.600
Do you think we could not wash our dirty linen in public?

240
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.160
I'm not the one who shat the bed.

241
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.280
Tara, could you give us two minutes? Yeah.

242
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.120
This situation calls for a black coffee and my Bluetooth headset.

243
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.000
Do not touch that phone, Glenn. That is a comms phone.

244
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.480
Erm... No filters, Emma. First thoughts. We're policy jamming here.

245
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.040
OK, erm, 24/7 parliament.

246
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.480
Oh, sorry, a little bit of mental housekeeping.

247
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.200
There is only positivity in the circle.

248
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.080
When someone makes a suggestion, we say, "yes and".

249
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.040
Yes and what?

250
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.880
We could, we could make a noise.

251
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.400
What noise would you suggest, Mary?

252
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.280
Yes and

253
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.160
ho. Great. Let's run with that. Yes and ho.

254
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.680
Thanks, Emma. 24/7 parliament.

255
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.880
ALL: Yes and ho.

256
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.200
Pay the unemployed to drive ambulances. Yes and ho.

257
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.240
Free thermals for the elderly. Yes and ho.

258
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.520
I'm just telling it straight. Adam, the girl is still in our office.

259
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.320
Well... Well, then, let's get rid of her.

260
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.280
Well, ask her out, that'll do it.

261
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.520
Did you get her a tea? What? Er, she needs a tea.

262
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.480
Well, get her a tea. You get her a tea.

263
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.440
She's your girlfriend. Get her a fucking tea.

264
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.360
I'm the minister. I don't even know where tea is made. Make her a tea.

265
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.880
Could you make her a tea? I'm in charge. You're not in charge. I am in charge.

266
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.840
Get hold of Mannion. They need to know about this. I am Mannion.

267
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.120
Hi. Sorry.

268
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.840
Can I get you anything? A tea, coffee?

269
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.880
Oh, no, don't, don't worry, you just... Sure? Yeah. OK, sit tight.

270
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.400
It's fine, the protest is over so it solves the problem. It's gone away.

271
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.000
It's like there's a little 12-year-old boy in a suit

272
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.640
with a fucking light sabre in his desk -

273
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.560
don't think I don't know it's there -

274
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.040
running this department when Mannion's away. Yeah? It's a fucking joke.

275
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.960
No, it's not, no, it's not. Have you seen Game of Thrones season 2? No.

276
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.680
Or Anakin Skywalker - he was young.

277
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.400
Er, Frodo, in his thirties - still young for a hobbit, you know?

278
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.000
I'm in charge because I'm a Jedi and you're a fucking Ewok.

279
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.680
Right, what is the Ewok position on this, then?

280
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.800
Free tea bags. Yes and ho.

281
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.160
Free maternity leave for people getting a puppy.

282
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.200
Yes and ho.

283
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.560
Obese Olympics.

284
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.920
Yes and ho.

285
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.760
The line from Stewart via Emma was that I do nothing.

286
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.000
That was the one clear instruction they gave me, OK?

287
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.920
We ignore him and he goes away. He is dead. Which makes him easier to ignore.

288
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.400
As a minister I should at least express condolences.

289
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.960
That, that should come from Peter. But he's not here. I am.

290
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.040
Has anyone seen my Bluetooth headset?

291
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.480
Look, I speak for Peter and I say that we look guilty if we say we're sorry he died.

292
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.320
I'll take that as a no.

293
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.320
Listen, Phil, I was a journalist, OK?

294
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.760
Now, if you don't respond you create a vacuum

295
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.440
that sucks in speculation

296
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.680
and then you can't respond - you get sucked fucking inside out.

297
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.960
Look, Tickle wasn't the Queen of people's hearts.

298
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.760
He was a twat in a tent. Tick-EL! He was called Tick-EL!

299
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.400
We drove a man to his death. We are responsible for this.

300
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.000
Glenn, please, shush.

301
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.240
Do you think we could just pretend to behave like compassionate professionals in control,

302
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.240
just for once? Yeah, OK, er...

303
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.920
Look, er, whatever the fallout from today, megaphone Mary,

304
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.440
you brought her in, she's your problem.

305
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.280
Right, fuck. Adam, we need to.

306
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.040
Could be... Hang on they're coming back. I'll ring you back.

307
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.400
Great stuff, Tara, we're going to go ahead with the bank.

308
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.200
Yep, meeting's over. Don't you need to talk to the Treasury?

309
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.880
Done that. OK, well, let's talk details.

310
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.680
When it comes to interest rates, there's still quite a lot... Hey, don't talk us out of it.

311
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.680
You don't want to do that. So, is this the green light?

312
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.200
Uh-huh, yep, £2 billion.

313
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.320
Oh, my God! Oh! Crikey. Ohh! That's great.

314
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.400
Oh, right, OK! Oh, my God. Great, great, terrific.

315
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.880
We'll be in touch. Thank you. Lovely to meet you. Great.

316
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.640
What have we just green-lit?

317
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.720
Well, we are starting a community bank with £2 billion.

318
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.600
Right, is that the £2 billion we keep in the biscuit tin?

319
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.280
This is just great, this is just fucking great.

320
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.320
Oh... I hang around this moral abattoir to do something exactly like this and you shut me out.

321
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.840
So I'm spending my bank holiday founding a bank?

322
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.000
I thought the point about bank holidays is that they're supposed to be shut.

323
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.280
You know, when we see something we like we just buy it,

324
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.880
that's the way we work round here.

325
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.800
I hope the Tickel situation is all OK.

326
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.760
Well, it'll be fine. Thank you. Great. Lovely to meet you. See you soon.

327
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.680
Right.

328
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.400
Right, I'm in fucking charge and I am going Nordic drama.

329
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.760
Adam, secure the economist. You get Stewart and Mannion back here stat.

330
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.880
Brilliant, got that guys, yeah? OK?

331
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.120
Sure, I'll do it your way for now, Fergus,

332
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.400
but they left me in charge for a reason.

333
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.760
I bet you line up all your action figures on the edge of your bath, don't you?

334
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.760
One, I've got a shower and two, they're still in the boxes.

335
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.840
Emma, it's Phil, same message as before. Tickle's topped himself, the press want me to respond,

336
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.280
so just fucking ring me, OK?

337
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.280
Have you got them? No, everyone's ignoring me.

338
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.160
It's like the first year of university.

339
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.600
Fuck it, the whole of university.

340
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.600
PHONE RINGS

341
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.840
Jesus. Hello?

342
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.000
No, I can categorically say that Peter Mannion will not be resigning over this.

343
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.160
Thank you. Who was that? World At One. I handled it.

344
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.440
You don't handle the World At One, Phil. They're not stolen goods.

345
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.040
If you want to go and play phones, you can go down to the creche

346
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.800
where there's a big phone with big boggly eyes

347
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.880
that go round and round when you wheel it about.

348
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.480
Now piddle off.

349
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.520
We've got to put something out there, Terri.

350
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.080
That boy is a simpleton.

351
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.840
Two hundred years ago they wouldn't have let him milk a cow.

352
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.160
Jonty! Terri here over at Hectic House.

353
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
SHE LAUGHS No! No, Peter's not resigning!

354
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.680
Free apples. Yes and ho.

355
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.960
Free coffins. Yes and ho.

356
00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.600
Reduce the deficit with spending cuts.

357
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.880
Yes and ho.

358
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.520
Peter, Peter, I want to hear new ideas ricocheting off your sinuses like a pinball,

359
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.320
not just a 2-year-old slogan.

360
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.200
OK, Dr Jazz, let's hear it.

361
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.920
We do away with computers.

362
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.520
Yes and ho. You idiot, that's fucking mental.

363
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.960
No blocking, Peter, only counterpoint.

364
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.640
Do away with computers, what do we think? How would it affect us?

365
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.760
Good idea, bad idea? Good idea for me. I wouldn't get any more of your fucking emails.

366
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.760
Try and stay cross-legged if you can, Peter. Don't break the circle.

367
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.400
I'm 54, Stewart. My knees are fucked and my patience is snapped.

368
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.200
Some of us had to go through this hippy shit the first time around.

369
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.600
I'm not talking about selling it to the electorate.

370
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.440
I'm talking about exploring it within the free space of the circle.

371
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.320
OK, give me the ball. Give me the ball. Give me the ball.

372
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.640
No. Give me the fucking ball, Stewart.

373
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.440
Let's do away with you. What?

374
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.240
Filters off, daddyo, let it all hang out.

375
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.000
Just suppose your free-range, no-consequences bullshit

376
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.440
was hugely entertaining when we were in opposition and shitting money

377
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.680
but now that we're in government and it's all gone a bit JG Ballard,

378
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.200
it's irrelevant and infantile.

379
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.480
Oh, very droll, Peter.

380
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.240
And maybe the reason you don't mind handing your phone in

381
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.520
is that it doesn't ring as much as it used to.

382
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.120
Oh, sorry, doesn't ring as much as it used to, yes and ho.

383
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.880
Er, I'm sorry but does the sign on the door say "do disturb"?

384
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.240
No. Sorry. It is urgent.

385
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.760
Your office says Peter Mannion and Stewart Pearson should check their phones and call back now, please.

386
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.000
Fine, well, you've, you've burst the thought bubble, erm, receptionist,

387
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.880
so that's great. Thank you very much. Fantastic.

388
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.480
OK, everyone just take...

389
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.480
Sorry, is that a phone, Emma?

390
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.080
Er, hotline, Number 10.

391
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.760
It's just I'm amending some boring policy drafts.

392
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.800
They're encrypted but I've got to keep it on me.

393
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.920
And Stewart hasn't got one.

394
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.360
Want the opinion of an old lag? Mannion will have to go.

395
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.520
Stick to policemen are getting younger, Glenn.

396
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.520
Peter's going nowhere

397
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.920
and I don't mean that in a Glenn's career kind of way.

398
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.040
I've seen a lot of people resign and they're always happier afterwards.

399
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.160
You're thinking of lobotomies.

400
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.960
Peter resigns over my dead body.

401
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.840
Yes, yes. That would be the ideal scenario.

402
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.920
It's probably just Phil, he's run out of colouring books or something.

403
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.680
Anything to get out of Stewart's think sphincter.

404
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.480
Hello, receptionist. Could I have my phone, please?

405
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.040
Your name, sir? It's Stewart. Stewart...? Stewart Pearson.

406
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.480
Peter Mannion, mine's the old Nokia. It's engaged.

407
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.520
Yeah, thank you. Look, the one with Stewart written on it.

408
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.200
No, nothing. Just keep trying. It's engaged.

409
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.040
I can't get any reception. No, you won't round here.

410
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.400
No reception at reception, we always say. The best spot, sounds stupid, is the children's play area.

411
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.560
Top of the slide.

412
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.320
Nothing.

413
00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.120
God, I hate the country. Get higher, you idiot.

414
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.520
That's it, that's it, I've got something.

415
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.080
Download the intel, Peter. Come on. Put it on speaker.

416
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.000
No. I've got loads of messages from my wife and from Phil.

417
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.320
She's taking the dog to the hospital. Oh, come on.

418
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.200
She's... She's had a long wait.

419
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.240
The wound in his paw's gone septic. Oh, please, Peter, move on.

420
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.200
Tickle's dead. What? Tickle's dead.

421
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.560
OK, it's my turn on that signal, Peter, get down.

422
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.080
Wait, I'm listening to the fucking message.

423
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.520
I need to get this signal. Just get down.

424
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.920
Stop being so childish. Jesus Christ. Just get down, Peter.

425
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.800
I've got it, I've got it. Playtime's over. Tickle's dead, OK?

426
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.960
Number 10's gone off-the-hook mental. Take my phone to call the PM.

427
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.120
Right, Phil's meeting us, he's going to bring a shirt, suit and tie.

428
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.680
You are not going to arrive looking like the manager of an organic wine bar.

429
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.440
Right, come on, come on, come on! Movement. Sh! Hello?

430
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.800
Update, Phil's intercepting Peter.

431
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.280
Everyone's coming back here, half an hour.

432
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.440
Coverly, comms. Yeah, can you hold on one second please?

433
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.280
ETA plus 30 minutes GMT.

434
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.080
Well, anyway, Mannion has surely got to freeze housing disposals now.

435
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.720
Yeah, on that point, Glenn, I wonder if it might be at all helpful

436
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.600
if we collated every single statement Mannion's made about Tickle and the sell-off policy.

437
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.720
Yeah, as a sort of favour to selected hacks,

438
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.600
put a bit of air between us and the policy, a lot of air.

439
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.360
Adam, this is not the time for party political point scoring.

440
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.480
At least let the body get cold. Of course. Understood.

441
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.880
What was it...? What was it Peter said to those Welsh chartered surveyors?

442
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.400
"The health service should be for care not subsidised housing."

443
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.480
Now, I mean, that is...

444
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.400
Jesus. Is this what we came into politics for?

445
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.880
Yeah, that and the pussy.

446
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.920
What's that? I'm supposed to be commenting on a suicide not a fucking camel race.

447
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.360
It will balance out the bad news. You know - yin-yang.

448
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.200
Jon Snow does it. I want Tickle's movements over the last 24 hours

449
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.480
and I want his complete mental health records since he first sat on a potty.

450
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.400
Do you think you might need one or two computers for that, Stewart?

451
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.080
We're going to try and dredge up some fire-fighting strategy.

452
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.560
Absolutely. I'll top-load you as soon as we arrive.

453
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.240
Yep, thanks. OK. All right. Bye.

454
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.200
Can I...? Can I take the seatbelt off?

455
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.440
No, Peter. Stewart, what are you doing?

456
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.360
It helps with the car sickness.

457
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.880
This is great, isn't it, Stewart?

458
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.400
A conference on crisis management that's been scuppered by an actual fucking crisis.

459
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.320
We don't even know why he killed himself yet.

460
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.840
I mean, suicide, it's pathetic.

461
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.640
At least take some of your enemies with you, that's a noble death.

462
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.920
This is going nuts. So many questions being asked.

463
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.160
It started with why did Phil bring a tie from the '90s?

464
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.880
I brought an alternative. But that's too far the other way. It makes him look guilty.

465
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.320
How can he be guilty? He's got the perfect alibi. He was at boot camp.

466
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.200
Oh! Brilliant, let's release that, hey?

467
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.720
There's no actual blood on his hands and he remembered to wipe the fingerprints off the knife.

468
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.760
Look, you can wear my tie, what about mine?

469
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.400
What's on your tie? Tintin moon rockets. Oh, for fuck's sake.

470
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.040
It amazes me you ever found your way out of your mother's womb.

471
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.320
Here he is! Minister! Minister, does the government have blood on its hands?

472
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.880
Are you resigning? Have you got anything to say to the family?

473
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.440
Shouldn't you have done more, Minister? Please! Not the trousers.

474
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.440
Let's show a little more decorum.

475
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.120
A man has died in tragic and complicated circumstances.

476
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.080
This is not the time for barked questions or hurried judgement.

477
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.760
There will be a statement presently.

478
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.600
Was Mr Tickel killed by politics, Mr Mannion?

479
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.280
Do relax... Heads up now, yeah?

480
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.120
Terri, poppet, can you send me out a cry mail?

481
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.440
"We give a toss, we're sorry for your loss, yeah?"

482
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.640
Peter, we might need to relaunch the trousers.

483
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.240
Get him a tie, a bland one. Glenn, one of yours, yeah?

484
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.000
Peter, I have a bit of news that I should probably make you aware of.

485
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.960
Yes, I do know, Fergus. A man with an amusing name has died.

486
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.280
Er, no, actually. It's that this morning I... Well, I set up a community bank.

487
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.120
What? You did what? You... You... You set up a bank?

488
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.040
I had a moment of weakness and they exploited it, like Hugh Grant.

489
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.120
Yeah, well, we didn't really have much choice

490
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.120
because it was all going to piss in a kettle here,

491
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.040
so we had to get the economist out of the way. What economist?

492
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.960
Well, we were having a preliminary meeting when Phil started to crow,

493
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.160
Glenn was having a meltdown - it was embarrassing.

494
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.880
You bought a bank out of social embarrassment?

495
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.320
I sometimes buy the Big Issue out of social embarrassment, I don't buy a fucking bank.

496
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.760
Oh... Peter, this is so fucking us.

497
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.720
Just wind back, right. Let's get this straight, so I can deal with you two properly.

498
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.160
How much is this bank?

499
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.600
Well, 2 billion. 2 billion.

500
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.360
2 billion! Sweet Tracy Emin!

501
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.760
All right, don't need to shit yourself about it because we're not buying it, OK?

502
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.040
It's funded by taxes. That's all right then.

503
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.920
Oh, great, the triple! I'm a nurse killer, a banker and now I'm raising fucking taxes!

504
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.040
Well, you are meant to be the bad cop, so what's our out?

505
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.440
You're giving me an actual noose along with the metaphorical one.

506
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.200
Trousers! Sorry, I'm getting your trousers.

507
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.200
TEXT ALERT

508
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.560
Jesus, what were you guys doing at the hotel? There's a picture of you on a slide.

509
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.680
It's been tweeted by a golfer. Oh, for...

510
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

511
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.080
It's gonna go big, bigger than Charlie bit my finger.

512
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.280
You look like the Shit Family Robinson. Aaahhhh!

513
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.800
Jesus Christ! Shit!

514
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.880
Oh, poor Stewart. I think a bit of his brain broke.

515
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.920
My phone broke. I was up to Warlock General in Dragonlance.

516
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.720
A year of my life, gone.

517
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.440
Er, Peter, speaking of socially embarrassing situations,

518
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.520
what the fuck were you doing being photographed on a slide?

519
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.520
It was the only place we could get a fucking signal.

520
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.400
Two grown men in a playground - that's a pretty clear signal.

521
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.960
Peter, Number 10 have seen the photo. They don't want you to make a statement.

522
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.680
Fergus, looks like you're up.

523
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.000
Statement on Tickle in 10 minutes OK? Bring it!

524
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.120
I'm gonna go and talk Stewart down. I don't want the fucking trousers.

525
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.560
ADAM: Peter, sorry to take this off you.

526
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.320
Yeah, but that's swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

527
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.640
MOBILE

528
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.640
Coverly, comms. Yeah, statement in er... Emma?

529
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.120
Yes. Statement in? Nine. Nine, nine minutes.

530
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.160
Yep. OK, everyone. Terri Coverly offline.

531
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.760
OK, shall I bring you some tea?

532
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.360
Oh, Peter, that tie's a bit rubbish, isn't it?

533
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.040
Can I just...? Why don't I just help you with that?

534
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.360
Just... I'm very willing to... Take it.

535
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.640
PHIL: Jesus, Christ, Terri. Next time why don't you just lick his spats?

536
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.920
This is not about changing policy, this is not about running away from our obligations...

537
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.040
Here you go. I managed to wrestle your tie back off Terri.

538
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.880
There's some of her fingernails in it.

539
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.880
Well, in the grand scheme of things, that's not such a big deal.

540
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.360
You're not gonna watch your guy give the statement? No.

541
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:41.240
He's not my guy, Phil. I'm on my own here. There's no one quite like me, not here, not any more.

542
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.520
Yeah. You're the last VHS in Oxfam.

543
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.720
They won't take them anymore, I've tried.

544
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.800
Series one to five of the X Files - nothing, can't give them away.

545
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.240
For a fairer NHS, for a fairer public housing programme.

546
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.440
He's exactly why people hate politicians.

547
00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.120
He's making me hate politicians, him in particular.

548
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.120
Any second now he's gonna do the imaginary tits.

549
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.000
There they are.

550
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.000
THEY CHUCKLE

551
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.320
Thank you.

552
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.760
Look at him.

553
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.000
Moments like this make you realise why Elvis shot so many TVs.

554
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.280
