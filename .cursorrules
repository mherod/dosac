# Project Configuration Rules

## Package Management
- Use pnpm exclusively for package management
- Node.js version: >= 18.0.0
- Keep pnpm-lock.yaml in version control

## Git Workflow
- Conventional commits required
- Pre-commit hooks must not be skipped
- All changes must be reviewed before staging
- Maximum commit message length: 100 characters

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration must be followed
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Next.js 14+ conventions
  - App Router required
  - Partial Prerendering (PPR) enabled where beneficial:
    - Configure with `ppr: 'incremental'` in `next.config.js`
    - Add `export const experimental_ppr = true` to pages that benefit from PPR
    - Ideal for routes with mixed static/dynamic content
    - Consider for high-traffic pages with cacheable content

## JSDoc Documentation
1. **Required Documentation**
   - Function declarations
   - Method definitions
   - Class declarations
   - Public API functions and methods
   - Exported utilities and helpers

2. **Documentation Format**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Brief description of what the function/class does
    * @param paramName - Description of the parameter
    * @returns Description of what is returned
    */
   ```

3. **Documentation Rules**
   - All public functions must have JSDoc comments
   - Parameter descriptions are required
   - Return value descriptions are required
   - Types are inferred from TypeScript (no need to specify)
   - Use present tense in descriptions
   - Keep descriptions concise but clear
   - Document side effects when present
   - Document thrown errors when applicable

4. **Component Documentation**
   - Document props using TypeScript interfaces
   - Document state management approach
   - Document side effects and cleanup
   - Document event handlers
   - Example:
   ```typescript
   interface ButtonProps {
     /** The text content to display in the button */
     label: string;
     /** Called when the button is clicked */
     onClick: () => void;
   }

   /**
    * A reusable button component with consistent styling
    */
   export function Button({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

5. **Hook Documentation**
   - Document hook purpose and usage
   - Document dependencies array items
   - Document cleanup functions
   - Document state updates
   - Example:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Manages caption state and provides update functions
    * @param initialText - The initial caption text
    * @returns Object containing caption state and update functions
    */
   export function useCaptionState(initialText: string) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

6. **API Route Documentation**
   - Document request parameters
   - Document response format
   - Document error responses
   - Document authentication requirements
   - Example:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Retrieves frame data for a specific episode
    * @param request - The incoming request object
    * @param params - Route parameters containing episodeId
    * @returns Frame data object or 404 if not found
    */
   export async function GET(
     request: Request,
     { params }: { params: { episodeId: string } }
   ) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Development Practices
- Feature branches required
- Pull requests required for main branch
- Tests required for new features
- Documentation updates required for changes

## Project Structure
- /app - Next.js app router pages
- /components - React components
- /lib - Utility functions and shared code
- /hooks - Custom React hooks
- /public - Static assets

## Dependencies
- Next.js canary (15.2.0-canary.33)
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

## Subtitle File Structure
- Two VTT formats maintained:
  - Base format (s##e##.vtt)
  - Named format (s##e##-names.vtt)
- Base format characteristics:
  - More verbose with ~1800 lines per episode
  - Splits overlapping dialogue into separate timestamp blocks
  - Uses additional line breaks for readability
- Named format characteristics:
  - More compact with ~1700 lines per episode
  - Includes speaker labels (e.g., "MALCOLM:", "HUGH:")
  - Groups related dialogue under single timestamps
  - Combines overlapping dialogue under speaker labels
- Both formats must:
  - Use WebVTT standard formatting
  - Maintain identical timestamps
  - Preserve all dialogue content
  - Start with "WEBVTT" header

## Frame Extraction Structure
- Located in `/public/frames/{episodeId}/`
- Each timestamp has its own directory named by timestamp (e.g., "05-31-360" for "05:31.360")
- Each timestamp directory contains:
  - `frame-blank.jpg` - Original frame at exact timestamp
  - `frame-blank2.jpg` - Frame captured 1 second after timestamp
  - `speech.txt` - Plain text of the subtitles
- Frame characteristics:
  - Extracted using ffmpeg at exact timestamps from VTT
  - Second frame captured exactly 1 second after first frame
  - Both frames use identical scaling (500px width)
  - JPEG format for all images
- Processing:
  - Frames are only extracted once and cached
  - Both frames must exist for a timestamp to be considered complete
  - Speech text is always synchronized with VTT content

## Code Review Practices
- Always check both component definition AND usage
- Review state management in parent components
- Verify default values in both props and state initialization
- When fixing UI issues:
  - Check the entire component chain
  - Review state management at each level
  - Don't assume defaults are being used without verification
- Document findings and learnings for team reference 

## Next.js Route Handlers

1. **Route Parameters**
   - Route params are always a Promise
   - Correct type: `{ params: Promise<{ paramName: string }> }`
   - Must await params before use:
   ```typescript
   export async function GET(
     request: NextRequest,
     { params }: { params: Promise<{ paramName: string }> }
   ) {
     const resolvedParams = await params;
     // Use resolvedParams.paramName
   }
   ``` 

## Character Profile Maintenance

1. **Profile Structure**
   - All profiles must include:
     ```typescript
     {
       name: string;          // Display name with titles
       shortName: string;     // Informal first name/nickname
       fullName: string;      // Complete formal name with all titles
       description: string;   // Brief role summary
       department: Department;
       role: Role;
       personal?: {
         age?: number;
         birthYear?: number;
         family?: {
           spouse?: boolean | { name: string; occupation?: string };
           children?: boolean;
           siblings?: boolean;
           nieces?: boolean;
         };
         background?: {
           education?: string;
           party?: string;
           affiliation?: string;
           career?: string[];
           interests?: string[];
         };
         relationships?: {
           past?: string[];
           present?: string[];
         };
       };
       details: string[];     // Chronological list of character details
     }
     ```

2. **Name Formatting**
   - MPs: "The Right Honourable [Name] MP"
   - Lords: "The Right Honourable the Lord [Name] of [Place]"
   - Doctors: "Dr. [Full Name]"
   - Use consistent title abbreviations (Rt Hon, Dr, MP)

3. **Department and Role Assignment**
   - Characters must be assigned to primary department even if they appear in multiple
   - Role must reflect most senior position held
   - Update department/role when character's position changes
   - Use appropriate constants from DEPARTMENTS and ROLES

4. **Career Timeline**
   - Include series numbers for role changes (e.g., "Series 1-3")
   - Use "present" suffix for ongoing roles
   - List positions chronologically in career array

   - End with character traits/personality
   - Maximum 30 detail entries per character

7. **Political Affiliations**
   - Always specify party membership
   - Include government/opposition status
   - Note any party faction alignments
   - Document changes in allegiance

8. **Relationship Documentation**
   - Cross-reference relationships between characters
   - Include dates/series for relationship changes
   - Note professional and personal relationships
   - Document rivalries and alliances

9. **Image Requirements**

   - Use consistent naming: [shortname].jpg
   - Maintain 1:1 aspect ratio
   - Minimum resolution: 500x500px
   - Maximum file size: 200KB

10. **Profile Updates**
    - Review profiles after each episode addition
    - Update career progression as needed
    - Add new relationships and events
    - Maintain chronological accuracy
    - Cross-reference with other characters

11. **Quality Control**
    - Verify all dates and series numbers
    - Check consistency with episode content
    - Validate relationship cross-references
    - Ensure proper title formatting
    - Review department/role assignments
    - Avoid subjective adjectives in descriptions (e.g., "feared", "inept", "highly competent")
    - Use neutral, factual language for character roles and relationships
    - Prefer official titles over colloquial terms (e.g., "Deputy Communications Director" vs "enforcer")

12. **Profile Page Layout**
    - Group characters by department
    - Sub-group by role within departments
    - Show full details on individual pages
    - Include relationship network diagram
    - Display career timeline visualization <cursor-tools Integration>
# Instructions
Use the following commands to get AI assistance:

**Web Search:**
`cursor-tools web "<your question>"` - Get answers from the web using Perplexity AI (e.g., `cursor-tools web "latest weather in London"`)
when using web for complex queries suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-research/<query summary>.md.

**Repository Context:**
`cursor-tools repo "<your question>"` - Get context-aware answers about this repository using Google Gemini (e.g., `cursor-tools repo "explain authentication flow"`)

**Documentation Generation:**
`cursor-tools doc [options]` - Generate comprehensive documentation for this repository (e.g., `cursor-tools doc --output docs.md`)
when using doc for remote repos suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-docs/<repo-name>.md.

**GitHub Information:**
`cursor-tools github pr [number]` - Get the last 10 PRs, or a specific PR by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github pr 123`)
`cursor-tools github issue [number]` - Get the last 10 issues, or a specific issue by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github issue 456`)

**Browser Automation (Stateless):**
`cursor-tools browser open <url> [options]` - Open a URL and capture page content, console logs, and network activity (e.g., `cursor-tools browser open "https://example.com" --html`)
`cursor-tools browser act "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Execute actions on a webpage using natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser observe "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Observe interactive elements on a webpage and suggest possible actions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser observe "interactive elements" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser extract "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Extract data from a webpage based on natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser extract "product names" --url=https://example.com/products`)

**Notes on Browser Commands:**
- All browser commands are stateless: each command starts with a fresh browser instance and closes it when done.
- When using `--connect-to`, special URL values are supported:
  - `current`: Use the existing page without reloading
  - `reload-current`: Use the existing page and refresh it (useful in development)
- Multi step workflows involving state or combining multiple actions are supported in the `act` command using the pipe (|) separator (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login | Type 'user@example.com' into email | Click Submit" --url=https://example.com`)
- Video recording is available for all browser commands using the `--video=<directory>` option. This will save a video of the entire browser interaction at 1280x720 resolution. The video file will be saved in the specified directory with a timestamp.
- DO NOT ask browser act to "wait" for anything, the wait command is currently disabled in Stagehand.

**Tool Recommendations:**
- `cursor-tools web` is best for general web information not specific to the repository.
- `cursor-tools repo` is ideal for repository-specific questions, planning, code review and debugging.
- `cursor-tools doc` generates documentation for local or remote repositories.
- `cursor-tools browser` is useful for testing and debugging web apps.

**Running Commands:**
1. **Installed version:** Use `cursor-tools <command>` (if in PATH) or `npm exec cursor-tools "<command>"`, `yarn cursor-tools "<command>"`, `pnpm cursor-tools "<command>"`.
2. **Without installation:** Use `npx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"` or `bunx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"`.
