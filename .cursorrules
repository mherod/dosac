## Subtitle File Structure
- Two VTT formats maintained:
  - Base format (s##e##.vtt)
  - Named format (s##e##-names.vtt)
- Base format characteristics:
  - More verbose with ~1800 lines per episode
  - Splits overlapping dialogue into separate timestamp blocks
  - Uses additional line breaks for readability
- Named format characteristics:
  - More compact with ~1700 lines per episode
  - Includes speaker labels (e.g., "MALCOLM:", "HUGH:")
  - Groups related dialogue under single timestamps
  - Combines overlapping dialogue under speaker labels
- Both formats must:
  - Use WebVTT standard formatting
  - Maintain identical timestamps
  - Preserve all dialogue content
  - Start with "WEBVTT" header
